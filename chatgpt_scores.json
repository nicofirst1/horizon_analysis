            "objective": "The ability to integrate data from multiple sources is nowadays a major competitive advantage for organizations. Data-driven applications using AI techniques are reshaping various industries such as manufacturing, tourism, and mobility. The European Strategy for Data aims to create a single market for data while ensuring Europe's global competitiveness and data sovereignty. This has led to the development of Common European data spaces, yet the governance of the data life cycle in organizations has not kept up with the rapid technology evolution and remains largely manual. This is especially evident in scenarios where tens or hundreds of continuously evolving data sources produce semi-structured data, and create significant challenges when governed manually, causing organizations to end up with data silos. A systematic and standardized mechanism is needed to ingest, integrate, and process data, thus boosting the ability to develop new data-centric business models. However, current research and development efforts typically target one aspect of the end-to-end data lifecycle, such as scalable data management, ML performance, AI explainability, or sharing, while dismissing its governance. To overcome this limitation, CyclOps proposes a new framework for the governance and maintenance of the complete data lifecycle for large-scale volumes of data generated in heterogeneous distributed sources to enable data sharing and exchange. CyclOps intelligently automates, by means of knowledge graphs (KGs) and with a human-in-the-loop approach, the generation and execution of data processing pipelines. KGs are the established formal models to represent data and metadata while providing context and guaranteeing interoperability with other systems adhering to the FAIR Guiding Principles. CyclOps will enable organizations to seamlessly provide, cross and analyze machine- and human-generated data from and for data spaces, thus facilitating the provision of added-value services on top.",

However, silicon-based devices have limitations such as rigidity, poor biocompatibility, and operating principles that differ from the ion signal modulation of biology. Organic mixed ionic-electronic conductors (OMIECs) have emerged as a promising option in the field of bioelectronics, as they are solution processable, potentially biocompatible, and can transport both electronic and ionic signals.\nThe goal of INFER is to create next-generation intelligent bioelectronic devices using in-operando electropolymerization of OMIEC monomers. The proposed research activities aim to 1) understand how the molecular properties of OMIEC monomers impact their in-operando electropolymerization and the learning capabilities of the resulting biomimetic devices, 2) achieve biorealistic speeds, memory functionalities, and energy efficiencies without the use of auxiliary devices, and 3) prototype devices that can locally sense, process, and actuate/stimulate.

To achieve this goal, it is imperative to develop energy-efficient intelligent electronics that have minimal device/circuit complexity and ion-based transducing and operating mechanisms akin to those observed in biology. The use of Silicon-based devices and circuits presents several limitations. Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) represent a rapidly advancing technology that plays a pivotal role in the development of next-generation bioelectronic devices. However, a notable limitation of OECTs is their typical operation in aqueous electrolytes, which can lead to undesired crosstalk between different devices on the same substrate, impeding their seamless integration into large-area arrays. Therefore, it is hard to develop neural networks based on the current OECTs. Solid electrolytes offer a promising solution to these challenges. In this proposal, I design a photo-patternable solid electrolyte to develop solid-state OECTs. The aim is to directly pattern the electrolyte using sequential ultraviolet light-triggered solubility modulation. We plan to use UV-sensitive PEGDA to directly pattern the hydrogel without requiring photoresist or lift-off processes. The PEGDA network will be covalently crosslinked after UV exposure to form a hydrogel network. The strong intermolecular interaction between the two networks will allow the UV-exposed regions to resist subsequent water development, while the UV-unexposed regions will remain water-soluble. This approach will enable the creation of smaller-size, large-area processing OECT devices, ultimately facilitating the development of OECNs with sizes approaching that of biological neurons.",

Perhaps the greatest mystery of modern ML---and arguably, one of the greatest mysteries of all of modern computer science---is the question of generalization: why do these immensely complex prediction rules successfully apply to future unseen instances?  Apart from the pure scientific curiosity it stimulates, I believe that this lack of understanding poses a significant obstacle to widening the applicability of ML to critical applications, like in healthcare or autonomous driving, where the cost of error is disastrous.  The broad goal of this project is to tackle the generalization mystery in the context of both statistical learning and reinforcement learning, focusing on optimization algorithms being the de facto contemporary standard in training learning models.  Our methodology points out to inherent shortcomings of widely accepted viewpoints with regard to generalization of optimization-based learning algorithms, and takes a crucially different approach that targets the optimization algorithm itself; building bottom-up from fundamental and tractable optimization models, we identify intrinsic properties and develop algorithmic methodologies that enable optimization to effectively generalize in modern statistical- and reinforcement-learning scenarios.  A successful outcome would not only lead to a timely and crucial shift in the way the research community approaches generalization of contemporary optimization-based ML, but it may also significantly transform the way we develop practical, efficient and reliable learning systems.",

Learning algorithms are applied in an ever-increasing variety of contexts, ranging from engineering challenges such as self-driving cars all the way to societal contexts involving private data. These developments pose important challenges (i) Many of the recent breakthroughs demonstrate phenomena that lack explanations, and sometimes even contradict conventional wisdom. One main reason for this is because classical ML theory adopts a worst-case perspective which is too pessimistic to explain practical ML: in reality data is rarely worst-case, and experiments indicate that often much less data is needed than predicted by traditional theory. (ii) The increase in ML applications that involve private and sensitive data highlights the need for algorithms that handle the data responsibly. While this need has been addressed by the field of Differential Privacy (DP), the cost of privacy remains poorly understood: How much more data does private learning require, compared to learning without privacy constraints? Inspired by these challenges, our guiding question is:  How much data is needed for learning? Towards answering this question we aim to develop a theory of generalization which complements the traditional theory and is better fit to model real-world learning tasks. We will base it on distribution-, data-, and algorithm-dependent perspectives. These complement the  distribution-free worst-case perspective of the classical theory, and are suitable for exploiting specific properties of a given learning task. We will use this theory to study various settings, including supervised, semisupervised, interactive, and private learning. We believe that this research will advance the field in terms of efficiency, reliability, and applicability. Furthermore, our work combines ideas from various areas in computer science and mathematics; we thus expect further impact outside our field.",

By applying pulsed, alternating electric currents to targets deep in the brain, DBS induces widespread changes in neural network activity. Although motor symptoms can be reduced by DBS in most patients, some patients suffer from severe side effects or insufficient symptom relief.\nMany attempts have been made to optimize the therapeutic effects of DBS, but these attempts have been restricted by a lack of understanding of how DBS exerts its therapeutic effects. Various therapeutic mechanisms have been proposed, but none have fully explained all of the complex effects of DBS. These theories have focused on direct and indirect effects of the strong electric fields near the stimulation contact.\nI propose a radically new hypothesis on the therapeutic mechanism of DBS that harnesses current insights from noninvasive brain stimulation. Weak electric fields during noninvasive brain stimulation have recently been shown to desynchronize neural activity from the surrounding network activity. I suggest that weak electric fields during DBS desynchronize cortical activity, which can, in combination with the effects of strong subcortical electric fields, reduce pathological synchrony in motor system networks and thereby restore motor control.\nDECODE will integrate large-scale volume conduction modeling to estimate and steer personalized electric fields, biophysical neural network modeling to understand the physiological consequences of weak fields and their interaction with strong field effects, and EEG measurements in humans to verify these models. Finally, based on the obtained knowledge and computational tools, DECODE will clinically test the hypothesis in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease. If successful, DECODE will start a new era in our understanding of the therapeutic network mechanisms of DBS and trigger clinical breakthroughs to optimize DBS therapy.",

Furthermore, personalized approaches for screening are needed, to consider genetic and other socioeconomic variables and environmental stressors that lead to different onsets of the disease. ONCOSCREEN responds to these challenges by developing a risk-based, population-level stratification methodology for CRC, to account for genetic prevalence, socio-economic status, and other factors. It complements this methodology by a) developing a set of novel, practical, and low-cost screening technologies with high sensitivity and specificity, b) leveraging AI to improve existing methodologies for CRC screening, allowing for the early detection of polyps and provision of a personalized risk status stratification, and c) providing a mobile app for self-monitoring and CRC awareness raising. Furthermore, ONCOSCREEN develops an Intelligent Analytics dashboard for policy makers facilitating effective policy making at regional and national levels. Through a multi-level campaign, the above-mentioned solutions are tested and validated. For the clinical solutions specifically, a clinical validation study has been planned with the participation of 4100 enrolled patients/citizens.

Identifying CRC early enables better treatment options. Screening usually entails a quantitative faecal immunological test (FIT) to predict the need of colonoscopy for the detection of colorectal lesions, an expensive and invasive procedure. We aim to predict this need with specificity increased by >20 percentage points by using metagenomic microbiomes. We hypothesise that computational microbiome profiles extracted using artificial intelligence (Al) technology will allow for optimised personal therapy stratification. However, clinicians do not have access to broad microbiome data. With Microb-AI-ome, we will develop a novel kind of computational stratification technology to enable microbiome-enhanced precision medicine of CRC. Metagenomic microbiome data to date is distributed over many national registries, and privacy regulations are hindering its effective integration. With Microb-AI-ome, we will overcome this barrier by establishing the first privacy-preserving federated big data network in CRC research. We will integrate isolated, national databases into one international federated database network - rather than a cloud - covering metagenomes for over 5,000 individuals screened for CRC, and an expected total of 100,000 by 2026. Microb-AI-ome ensures that no sensitive patient data will leave the safe harbours of the local databases while still allowing for the classification of clinical CRC phenotypes, which we will demonstrate in clinical practice allowing regulatory bodies to adopt evidence-based guidelines.

Quantum sensors are far more precise than their classical counterpart, potentially allowing them to probe a vast range of physical properties, from magnetic fields to gravity, with unprecedented sensitivity.

In this context, additive manufacturing (AM) as one of the disruptive, green production technologies of our time \"is expected to become a key manufacturing technology in the sustainable society of the future\" [2].\n\nHowever, alloys specifically designed for AM are rarely available, which prohibits AM from reaching its full potential. In contrast to conventional alloys and processing, alloys processed by AM are highly microstructurally heterogeneous. It is the aim of HeteroGenius4D to use the process-inherent conditions of highly precise, bottom-up AM approach to tailor these heterogeneous structures (e.g. grains/phases and their boundaries and orientations, chemical gradients, etc.) locally and spatially on various length scales. This is the basis for the novel design concept of heterogeneities-guided alloy design for AM. The potential to print local microstructures and properties in AM adds a 4th dimension to the design of 3D printed components; i.e. enables 4D printing.\n\nAM-processed metals with increasing degree of heterogeneity (from pure element over solid solutions with chemical gradients to multi-phase alloys with further phases and gradients) are studied systematically. The process-structure-properties-performance linkages are identified and quantified by combining high-throughput material synthesis (using extreme high-speed laser material deposition) and characterization with physics-based simulation tools, enabling a comprehensive integrated computational materials engineering (ICME) framework. The generated data serves as a basis for sophisticated data-driven (machine learning, ML) materials modelling and enables the establishment of an Experiments-ICME-ML optimal design approach for metal AM. Finally, the concept of heterogeneities-guided alloy design is generalised and transferred to graded components.",

One of the main obstacles that prevent AM from expanding its application towards fulfilling the requisites of sustainability and green manufacturing, is poor fatigue resistance of AM material caused by multiple intrinsic surface and internal defects. \nCurrently, different post-processing treatments are being used to tackle this challenge by enhancing surface regularity and reducing bulk defects. Despite the enhancement of fatigue resistance after the aforementioned treatments, these are additional steps that result in longer production times and higher costs. Moreover, due to the complexity of geometry and size, sometimes AM components cannot be easily post-processed by regular treatments. \nOptimizing the AM processes aiming at maximized fatigue life is a plausible solution that significantly minimizes the need for post-processing. However, the main barrier here is the lack of accurate, fast, and economic prediction tools to correlate fatigue life directly to AM process parameters. FLAME will address the aforementioned needs and pave the way towards efficient fatigue life assessment of AM via developing a hybrid framework through the association of physics-based models and machine learning approaches. It will improve the state-of-the-art fatigue life prediction accuracy from 75% to 90%, making them more economical by eliminating experiments and fast with an implementation time of less than 1 minute. \nFLAME, through its aforementioned performance, will effectively maximize the fatigue life at the design stage which results in a reduction of post-processing demand and a decrease in production costs. Moreover, it boosts the advancement of AM technology to replace the conventional methods paving the path to sustainable manufacturing and minimizing environmental impacts.",

Recent advances in electron microscopy will soon provide detailed reconstructions of large-scale neuronal networks from different brain areas, species, developmental stages and/or pathological conditions.

To achieve the aforementioned objectives in a sustainable way, it is well understood that new approaches are needed in the way the telco infrastructures are architected, federated and orchestrated. These new approaches call for multi-stakeholder ecosystems that promote synergies among MNOs and owners of all kinds or computational and networking resources that will share the extraordinary costs of yet another generation upgrade from 5G to 6G, while facilitating new business models. It is clear, that the new architecture paradigms bring unprecedented complexity due to the sheer scale and heterogeneity of the orchestration domains involved, that should be matched by equally capable automation capabilities, thus 6G is aiming for the \"holy grail\" of pervasive AI-driven intelligence, termed as Native AI. However, the multi-stakeholder infrastructures foreseen in 6G as per the \"network of networks\" concept, will add a level of unprecedented management complexity due to the sheer scale and heterogeneity of the orchestration domains involved. 6G-INTENSE aims to abstract and federate all kinds of computational and communication resources under an internet-scale framework, that is governed by an intelligent orchestration paradigm, termed as DIMO.",

Interventions are often carried out during the latter stages of development, leading to low patient survival rates and poor quality of life. In 2022 a European Commission report stated that \"colonoscopy-based screening has higher sensitivity than testing for blood in stool, but it is less acceptable to participants\". At the same time, effective methods to treat polyps in the colon are limited. Current approaches are often associated with unsafe oncological margins and high complication rates, requiring life-changing surgery.\nEndoTheranostics will usher in a new era for screening colonoscopy, advancing the frontiers of medical imaging and robotics. A tip-growing or eversion robot with a sleeve-like structure will be created to extend deep into hollow spaces while perceiving the environment through multimodal imaging and sensing. It will also act as a conduit to transfer miniaturised instruments to the remote site within the colon for diagnosis and therapy (theranostics). With these capabilities, the system will be able to offer:\n1. painless colon cleansing in preparation for endoscopy;\n2. real-time polyp detection and tissue characterisation through AI-assisted multimodal imaging;\n3. effective removal of polyps by conveying a \"miniature mobile operating chamber\" equipped with microsurgical tools to the target through the lumen of the eversion robot.\nThe unique technical and clinical challenges will be tackled by the PIs, each bringing complementary skills, backed by their institutions with wide expertise and exceptional facilities. The synergy and added value evident in this team will lead to breakthroughs not possible through independent research. The outcomes of EndoTheranostics will revolutionise the theranostics of CRC, impacting the quality of life of millions of individuals. Ultimately it will launch a new era for endoluminal intervention with applications beyond medicine.",

Identifying CRC early enables better treatment options. Screening usually entails a quantitative faecal immunological test (FIT) to predict the need of colonoscopy for the detection of colorectal lesions, an expensive and invasive procedure. We aim to predict this need with specificity increased by >20 percentage points by using metagenomic microbiomes. We hypothesise that computational microbiome profiles extracted using artificial intelligence (Al) technology will allow for optimised personal therapy stratification. However, clinicians do not have access to broad microbiome data. With Microb-AI-ome, we will develop a novel kind of computational stratification technology to enable microbiome-enhanced precision medicine of CRC. Metagenomic microbiome data to date is distributed over many national registries, and privacy regulations are hindering its effective integration. With Microb-AI-ome, we will overcome this barrier by establishing the first privacy-preserving federated big data network in CRC research. We will integrate isolated, national databases into one international federated database network - rather than a cloud - covering metagenomes for over 5,000 individuals screened for CRC, and an expected total of 100,000 by 2026. Microb-AI-ome ensures that no sensitive patient data will leave the safe harbours of the local databases while still allowing for the classification of clinical CRC phenotypes, which we will demonstrate in clinical practice allowing regulatory bodies to adopt evidence-based guidelines.

Learning algorithms are applied in an ever-increasing variety of contexts, ranging from engineering challenges such as self-driving cars all the way to societal contexts involving private data. These developments pose important challenges (i) Many of the recent breakthroughs demonstrate phenomena that lack explanations, and sometimes even contradict conventional wisdom. One main reason for this is because classical ML theory adopts a worst-case perspective which is too pessimistic to explain practical ML: in reality data is rarely worst-case, and experiments indicate that often much less data is needed than predicted by traditional theory. (ii) The increase in ML applications that involve private and sensitive data highlights the need for algorithms that handle the data responsibly. While this need has been addressed by the field of Differential Privacy (DP), the cost of privacy remains poorly understood: How much more data does private learning require, compared to learning without privacy constraints? Inspired by these challenges, our guiding question is:  How much data is needed for learning? Towards answering this question we aim to develop a theory of generalization which complements the traditional theory and is better fit to model real-world learning tasks. We will base it on distribution-, data-, and algorithm-dependent perspectives. These complement the  distribution-free worst-case perspective of the classical theory, and are suitable for exploiting specific properties of a given learning task. We will use this theory to study various settings, including supervised, semisupervised, interactive, and private learning. We believe that this research will advance the field in terms of efficiency, reliability, and applicability. Furthermore, our work combines ideas from various areas in computer science and mathematics; we thus expect further impact outside our field.",

However, most of the machines used are black boxes, and the causal relation between inputs and outputs is often impossible to extract. Nonetheless, a critical aspect when dealing with physical systems is not only to make correct predictions, but to understand the physical laws which underlie these assessments. Recently, an increasing number of works aim at developing interpretable ML methods, from which such hidden laws can be extracted. However, their application to physics has been often limited to supervised and unsupervised learning approaches.\nThe aim of this project is: 1) construct an interpretable reinforcement learning method; 2) extract hidden rules and features in timely and paramount problems in physics. The method combines three well-established concepts of ML: projective simulation, graph neural networks (GNN) and hidden variable disentanglement. PS provides interpretable RL agents that can be trained for a variety of tasks, from the construction of quantum experiments, via skill acquisition in robotics, to the modelling of honeybee colonies. By enhancing their learning power and interpretability with GNNs and variable disentanglement, we will extract the hidden features of the systems the RL agents have interacted with and ultimately, the physical laws governing them. In particular, we will tackle problems in the field of condensed matter, where particles diffuse either passively or actively, to reach a target state. Moreover, we will consider ensembles of RL agents, so as to analyze not only the physical properties of the systems, but also their interactions and communication dynamics in the quest of a common target.\nThe originality of the proposal is directly related to: 1) the methods that will be developed; 2) the systems of study; 3) most importantly, the information we will access and discover with the interpretable RL agents.",

However, EV adoption is still low for several reasons, mainly concerns about the lack of charging infrastructure from the EV drivers' view, known as range anxiety. Many studies believe deploying more public EV charging stations (EVCSs) can ease this anxiety among EV drivers. Still, EVCSs are not yet widely available due to profitability issues and putting more stress on the grid. While the growth of the EVCSs is moving slowly, the number of household charger installations is growing rapidly. However, scarce studies have investigated the potential of household chargers in providing public charging services. Further, many households are already equipped with renewables and sell the surplus energy to the grid through local flexibility markets. With renewables, household chargers can provide cheaper charging services while minimizing the negative grid impacts of EV charging. This project intends to alleviate the range anxiety in two ways. First, we will enhance the charging infrastructure availability by encouraging households to sell surplus energy to EVs through a market framework called the charging market, besides flexibility markets. We will design a coordinated bidding strategy model from the household viewpoint based on AI to maximize profit from the two markets (Work Package 1). Second, we will improve charging infrastructure accessibility by developing an AI-based charging recommendation model to guide EV drivers on when and where to get recharged (Work Package 2). Finally, we will conduct software implementation and real-time performance validation of the proposed AI-based models (Work Package 3).

Currently, the commercialization of quantum computers for real life applications is still a long shot due to major technical challenges like decoherence, a process in which the environment interacts with quantum bits and changes their quantum behavior causing computing errors.\nTopological quantum computer platforms offer an alternative route where the topological nature of quantum bits protects them from decoherence, therefore not needing error correction protocols that constraint development of commercial quantum computing systems. These mainly rely on Majorana zero modes, which are topological boundary modes predicted to be decoupled from decoherence. Topological computation is achieved by braiding of Majorana zero modes, but their manipulation is still an experimental challenge.\nThe TopoTapered project aims to develop tapered nanowires and tapered nanowire networks as a scalable technology for auto-tuning, transportation and braiding of Majorana zero modes bound at ends of topological superconducting segments. The innovative tapered nanowire platform for quantum computers will support topologically protected quantum bits making it possible to incorporate the large number of them needed for processing quantum information in quantum computers. Hence, TopoTapered will develop a simplified quantum computer architecture which will be both robust and scalable and therefore will shorten the time to market for quantum computers. \nFurthermore, to ensure the successful commercialization of our innovation, we will identify our product position in the quantum computing value chain and define the most suitable commercialization plan to establish a sustainable business model for TopoTapered.",

All those drawbacks do not allow practical applications of soft robotic devices for at home assistance and rehabilitation during activities of daily living, where they are intended and most needed. The core objective of TEXWEAROTS is to develop untethered knitted soft robotic assistive devices to overcome current drawbacks related to the wearable soft-robotic system reliability, mobility, sustainability, and integration. TEXWEAROTS focuses on the development of a knitted robotic glove free from bulky components with seamlessly integrated actuation, sensing, and self-powering functionalities. With my solid experience in textile manufacturing, soft sensors, and soft robotics, I will leverage the latest advances in digital machine knitting to manufacture 3D actuator shells with the integrated functionalities in a monolithic manner. This will lead to garment-like customizable textile-based robotic devices which are highly scalable and reliable. Furthermore, I will enable thermally powered fluidic actuation mechanism through integration of soft Peltier cooling functionality which enhances the actuator response time needed for motion assistance applications.

Re-use of both structured and unstructured data has the potential for major health benefits for the population suffering from CVD. Healthcare data re-use in Europe faces privacy and fragmentation issues, a high diversity in data formats and languages, and a lack of technical and clinical interoperability. DataTools4Heart (DT4H) will tackle such challenges and develop a comprehensive, federated, privacy-preserving cardiology data toolbox. This will include, in an integrated platform, standardised data ingestion and harmonisation tools providing a common data model, multilingual natural language processing, federated machine learning, differentially private data synthesis generation, and 7 language models adapted to the cardiology domain. DT4H virtual assistants will help scientists and clinicians navigate through large-scale multi-source cardiology data. These tools will be: i) implemented ensuring privacy-by-design and thorough compliance with European regulations and data standards; ii) optimised as based on multi-stakeholder user-centred requirements; and, iii) validated in 7 clinical sites across Europe.\n\nDT4H will unlock currently inaccessible health data in unstructured data and allow multi-site federated data use. Together with its toolbox, DT4H will leave the legacy of a federated learning platform with an embedded metadata catalogue and AI virtual assistants, and the CardioSynth open database of synthetic data remaining as available for further research and AI experimentation. Effective use of the federated learning platform will improve enable improved AI diagnostic and treatment tools. Deployment of regulated solutions will extend existing healthcare management paradigms to reduce disease burden. Finally, DT4H tools, systems and methodology are highly generalised and will translate well to other clinical and research areas in medicine.",

Despite the progress in the field, synthesizing a MOF currently requires tens to hundreds costly and time-consuming trial-and-error synthesis experiments because our ability to correlate the synthesis conditions with the desired MOF structure is very limited. To overcome this, we need to decode the mechanisms underlying MOF self-assembly, a highly complex non-equilibrium process covering a wide range of time- and length-scales, from the formation of the building units to nucleation and growth.\nIn MAGNIFY, my team and I will develop a multi-scale computational methodology that will decode the mechanisms underlying MOF self-assembly and predict synthesis conditions-structure relationships. This ambitious interdisciplinary project combines state-of-the-art multi-scale modelling techniques (enhanced sampling techniques, ab initio, atomistic and coarse-graining modelling), with machine-learning approaches to data analysis (dimensionality reduction and data clustering techniques) trained on new chemical descriptors. We will develop and validate our models in tandem with synthesis experiments. We will test our methodology by applying it to two central problems in MOF rational design: (i) determining how synthesis conditions (temperature, solvent, reactants, metal-to-ligand ratio, additives) drive the resulting MOF material's topology and point defects, as well as to (ii) tackling the very challenging task of predicting the synthesis conditions for producing brand new MOFs. This high-risk high-gain project will produce a breakthrough in the MOF field by enabling fast and resource-efficient MOF rational design and will open new research avenues in investigating the self-assembly of other materials and other complex processes happening through a large span of time- and length-scales.",

The full potential of MOFs for target applications can only be unlocked if the storage and transport properties for important chemical and biological guest molecules trapped in the pores of each MOF are known. In this project, I will create a materials intelligence ecosystem for precisely assessing guest storage and transport properties of all MOFs by combining state-of-the-art atomistic calculations, molecular simulations, machine learning, and data science, integrated with past and future experiments. I will focus on ten critical guest molecules to address the key societal challenges of our world: hydrogen and methane to use MOFs for clean energy storage; ammonia, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide to use MOFs for capturing toxic gas and combatting global warming; fluorouracil, methotrexate, nitrogen, oxygen to use MOFs as nanocarriers for anti-cancer drug therapy and biomedicine.

Despite their success, DL methods do not obey most of the wisdoms of statistical learning theory, and the vast majority of the current DL techniques mainly stand as poorly understood black-box algorithms. \n\nEven though DL theory has been a very active research field in the past few years, there is a significant gap between the current theory and practice: (i) the current theory often becomes vacuous for models with large number of parameters (which is typical in DL), and (ii) it cannot capture the interaction between data, architecture, training algorithm and its hyper-parameters, which can have drastic effects on the overall performance. Due to this lack of theoretical understanding, designing new DL systems has been dominantly performed by ad-hoc, 'trial-and-error' approaches.\n\nThe main objective of this proposal is to develop a mathematically sound and practically relevant theory for DL, which will ultimately serve as the basis of a software library that provides practical tools for DL practitioners. In particular, (i) we will develop error bounds that closely reflect the true empirical performance, by explicitly incorporating the dynamics aspect of training, (ii) we will develop new model selection, training, and compression algorithms with reduced time/memory/storage complexity, by exploiting the developed theory.\n\nTo achieve the expected breakthroughs, we will develop a novel theoretical framework, which will enable tight analysis of learning algorithms in the lens of dynamical systems theory. The outcomes will help relieve DL from being a black-box system and avoid the heuristic design process. We will produce comprehensive open-source software tools adapted to all popular DL libraries, and test the developed algorithms on a wide range of real applications arising in computer vision, audio/music/natural language processing.",

            "objective": "\"Deep Learning (DL) has reached unparalleled performance in many domains. However, this impressive performance typically comes at the cost of gathering large datasets and training massive models, requiring extended time and prohibitive costs. Significant research efforts are being invested in improving DL training efficiency, i.e., the amount of time, data, and resources required to train these models, by changing the model (e.g., architecture, numerical precision) or the training algorithm (e.g., parallelization). Other modifications aim to address critical issues, such as credibility and over-confidence, which hinder the implementation of DL in the real world. However, such modifications often cause an unexplained degradation in the generalization performance of DL to unseen data. Recent findings suggest that this degradation is caused by changes to the hidden algorithmic bias of the training algorithm and model. This bias selects a specific solution from all solutions which fit the data. After years of trial-and-error, this bias in DL is often at a \"sweet spot\" which implicitly allows ANNs to learn well, due to unknown key design choices. But performance typically degrades when these choices change. Therefore, understanding and controlling algorithmic bias is the key to unlocking the true potential of deep learning.\n\nOur goal is to develop a rigorous theory of algorithmic bias in DL and to apply it to alleviate critical practical bottlenecks that prevent such models from scaling up or implemented in real-world applications.\n\nOur approach has three objectives: (1) identify the algorithmic biases affecting DL; (2) understand how these biases affect the functional capabilities and generalization performance; and (3) control these biases to alleviate critical practical bottlenecks. To demonstrate the feasibility of this challenging project, we describe how recent advances and concrete preliminary results enable us to effectively approach all these objectives.\"",

Furthermore, personalized approaches for screening are needed, to consider genetic and other socioeconomic variables and environmental stressors that lead to different onsets of the disease. ONCOSCREEN responds to these challenges by developing a risk-based, population-level stratification methodology for CRC, to account for genetic prevalence, socio-economic status, and other factors. It complements this methodology by a) developing a set of novel, practical, and low-cost screening technologies with high sensitivity and specificity, b) leveraging AI to improve existing methodologies for CRC screening, allowing for the early detection of polyps and provision of a personalized risk status stratification, and c) providing a mobile app for self-monitoring and CRC awareness raising. Furthermore, ONCOSCREEN develops an Intelligent Analytics dashboard for policy makers facilitating effective policy making at regional and national levels. Through a multi-level campaign, the above-mentioned solutions are tested and validated. For the clinical solutions specifically, a clinical validation study has been planned with the participation of 4100 enrolled patients/citizens. To ensure the adoption of the developed solutions by the healthcare systems, their cost-effectiveness and financial viability will be assessed.

A tip-growing or eversion robot with a sleeve-like structure will be created to extend deep into hollow spaces while perceiving the environment through multimodal imaging and sensing. It will also act as a conduit to transfer miniaturised instruments to the remote site within the colon for diagnosis and therapy (theranostics). With these capabilities, the system will be able to offer:\n1. painless colon cleansing in preparation for endoscopy;\n2. real-time polyp detection and tissue characterisation through AI-assisted multimodal imaging;\n3. effective removal of polyps by conveying a \"miniature mobile operating chamber\" equipped with microsurgical tools to the target through the lumen of the eversion robot.\nThe unique technical and clinical challenges will be tackled by the PIs, each bringing complementary skills, backed by their institutions with wide expertise and exceptional facilities. The synergy and added value evident in this team will lead to breakthroughs not possible through independent research.

Furthermore, personalized approaches for screening are needed, to consider genetic and other socioeconomic variables and environmental stressors that lead to different onsets of the disease. ONCOSCREEN responds to these challenges by developing a risk-based, population-level stratification methodology for CRC, to account for genetic prevalence, socio-economic status, and other factors. It complements this methodology by a) developing a set of novel, practical, and low-cost screening technologies with high sensitivity and specificity, b) leveraging AI to improve existing methodologies for CRC screening, allowing for the early detection of polyps and provision of a personalized risk status stratification, and c) providing a mobile app for self-monitoring and CRC awareness raising. Furthermore, ONCOSCREEN develops an Intelligent Analytics dashboard for policy makers facilitating effective policy making at regional and national levels. Through a multi-level campaign, the above-mentioned solutions are tested and validated. For the clinical solutions specifically, a clinical validation study has been planned with the participation of 4100 enrolled patients/citizens.

Learning algorithms are applied in an ever-increasing variety of contexts, ranging from engineering challenges such as self-driving cars all the way to societal contexts involving private data. These developments pose important challenges (i) Many of the recent breakthroughs demonstrate phenomena that lack explanations, and sometimes even contradict conventional wisdom. One main reason for this is because classical ML theory adopts a worst-case perspective which is too pessimistic to explain practical ML: in reality data is rarely worst-case, and experiments indicate that often much less data is needed than predicted by traditional theory. (ii) The increase in ML applications that involve private and sensitive data highlights the need for algorithms that handle the data responsibly. While this need has been addressed by the field of Differential Privacy (DP), the cost of privacy remains poorly understood: How much more data does private learning require, compared to learning without privacy constraints? Inspired by these challenges, our guiding question is:  How much data is needed for learning? Towards answering this question we aim to develop a theory of generalization which complements the traditional theory and is better fit to model real-world learning tasks.

There is a continuous debate regarding whether AI is worthy of trust. The EU AI HLEG has defined that trustworthy AI systems should be lawful, ethical and robust. To translate it into actionable practices, provision of explainability, fairness and privacy is crucial. A considerable volume of research has been conducted in the areas of explainable AI, fair AI and privacy-preserving AI. However, the current research efforts to tackle the three challenges are fragmented and have culminated in a variety of solutions with heterogeneous, non-interoperable, or even conflicting capabilities.  The ambitious vision of HarmonicAI is to build a human-machine collaborative multi-objective design framework to foster coherently explainable, fair and privacy-preserving AI for digital health. HarmonicAI draws together proven experts in AI, health care, IoT, data science, privacy, cyber security, software engineering, HCI and industrial design with an underlying common aim to develop concrete technical and operational guidelines for AI practitioners to design human-centered, domain-specific, requirement-oriented trustworthy AI solutions, accelerating the scalable deployment of AI-powered digital health services and offering assurance to the public that AI in digital health is being developed and used in an ethical and trustworthy manner.",

The storage and transport of hydrogen, however, faces important challenges which hinder its broad application as an alternative and zero emission fuel. Storage of hydrogen as a gas typically requires high-pressure tanks (up to 700 bar tank pressure); storage of hydrogen as a liquid requires cryogenic temperatures because the boiling point of hydrogen at one atmosphere pressure is -253C. Therefore, for several applications, ammonia rises as a rather prominent vector if it can be produced efficiently. The production is traditionally bound by the constraints of thermodynamics, which require high synthesis pressures, as well as temperatures. Thus, NH3 is produced centralised/large-scaled. \nHySTrAm builds on developing physical H2 storage materials, enabling short term storage (buffering renewables dynamics), as well as the 3 structural corner stones of flexible low pressure NH3: decreased Ru content catalysts, high temperature NH3 sorbents and induction-heated support granting (optimal) responsiveness. The project will demonstrate a compact containerised ammonia synthesis system which is based on two main consecutive stages:1) A short-term storage hydrogen vessel which will serve as a buffer to store and transport the hydrogen produced by electrolysis. Within the hydrogen vessel, new ultraporous material will be identified and optimised through machine learning technology 2) An ammonia synthesis reactor based on an improved the Haber-Bosch process where the stored hydrogen will react with nitrogen to form ammonia using the novel catalysts and sorbents developed in HySTrAm.",

Developing sustainable, efficient and safe hydrogen storage technologies has, however, proved challenging. MOST-H2, in full alignment with the requirements of HORIZON-CL4-2021-RESILIENCE-01-17, proposes an integrated multiscale lab-to-tank approach to develop, validate and demonstrate innovative, low cost cryo-adsorptive hydrogen storage, using monolithic Metal-Organic Framework (MOF) adsorbents, with an optimal combination of volumetric and gravimetric capacity, but also a small environmental footprint. Advanced synthetic strategies and sophisticated computational techniques, including molecular simulation and machine learning, will be combined in a cyclic materials development approach, to deliver new high performance, sustainable-by-design MOF adsorbents. The main aim is to computationally design, then synthesise and validate experimentally, ultra porous MOFs with usable storage capacities above 10 wt% and 50 g/L on a materials basis, at an operating pressure below 100 bar. This represents an essential step towards more efficient, intrinsically safer and cost effective storage solutions, compared to conventional hydrogen storage technologies. An important part of the project will be devoted to developing and upscaling monolithic forms of optimal MOF materials to allow easy integration into a cryo-adsorption storage tank, specifically designed for this purpose, which will be tested in a TRL 5 environment. The outcomes, coupled with full life cycle analysis and techno-economic assessment of MOST-H2 technology, with a view to selected end uses (rail and road applications), will form the basis for elaborating future market penetration plans through a solid horizontal dissemination and exploitation strategy.",

AI has been rapidly growing in various industries, from financial services to healthcare, education, and job recruitment. However, as AI algorithms have become increasingly sophisticated and pervasive in decision-making processes, concerns have arisen about their fairness and compliance with regulations. In particular, the EU AI Act requires that AI providers in high-risk applications -- such as employment, credit, or healthcare -- to identify (and thereby address) discrimination by their algorithms against certain demographics of people.

Addressing existing disconnects between AI fairness toolkits' capabilities and current practitioner needs, the Act.AI tool can be easily integrated into any AI workflow, in a plug and play fashion, to continuously monitor and improve its fairness. A key aspect of Act.AI is the ability to operate with different types of data (tabular, images, and text) in a variety of contexts (binary and multiclass classification and regression). It is also able to match datasets in different domains including out-of-distribution data even if these datasets have different numbers of variables or features.

IoT leads to a high automation potential with which we improve the life of billions of people and compensate for societal problems such as a growingly old population, missing high-skilled labour across Europe or the efficiency limits in current production capabilities. IoT5.0, an Artificial Intelligence (AI) -assisted Internet of Things, could even more benefit society, as the devices could even learn how to provide more value. But the ubiquitous connectivity comes at a cost. Security levels have to rise tremendously to ensure a network stays secure and safe for humans. This additional effort often is a burden for small and medium sized enterprises as the complexity and security demands of such systems rise faster than available resources. This is especially dangerous as a single corrupted, malicious device can result in the exploitation of the entire network of connected devices by an attacker. Consequently, RESILIENT TRUST focuses on end-to-end security of IoT processing chains with a focus on strong exploitation for SMEs. This vision will be realized by developing specialized hardware to establish TRUST in-between a network and a wall of RESILIENCE even against new attack methods such as post quantum attacks and AI based attacks. The architecture of the secure processing chain will be carefully built after threat modelling, asset identification, risk analysis, security objectives and requirements definition. Consequently, RESILIENT TRUST will address and significantly mitigate these major risks to enable IoT5.0. That way this project will be a driver for sustainable development and the generation of convenience and wealth. A solution is proposed to ensure end-to-end security by boosting RESILIENCE and TRUST along different key supply chains of IoT device",

Minor Objectives or Methods: Both projects address IoT challenges \u2013 ELEGANCE focuses on energy-efficient edge computing with eco-sustainable technologies, while Resilient Trust emphasizes end-to-end security for IoT systems. There are some minor overlaps in the domain but the core objectives differ significantly. (1 point)\n\n2. Overlapping Goals, Methodologies, or Innovations: Both projects aim to enhance the IoT landscape though one concentrates on eco-friendly computing technologies (ELEGANCE) and the other on robust security measures (Resilient Trust). There is some overlap with the IoT context and a shared interest in innovative tech and AI, but their primary goals and methodologies are distinct enough. (1 point)\n\n3. Key Similarities in Scope, Methodology, and Innovation: While both projects push the boundaries of IoT technology, ELEGANCE focuses deeply on sustainable materials and processing methods while Resilient Trust dedicates itself to building secure and resilient IoT infrastructures. Their methodologies significantly diverge in these respects; retaining independence might benefit from specialized focus areas. (0 points)\n\n4.

            "objective": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in the employment sector to manage and control individual workers. One type of AI is Natural Language Processing (NLP) based tools that can analyze text to make inferences or decisions. A recent Sage study found that 24% of companies used AI for hiring purposes. In an employment context, this can involve analyzing text created by an employee or recruitment candidate in order to assist management in deciding to invite a candidate for an interview, to training and employee engagement, or to monitor for infractions that could lead to disciplinary proceedings. However, the models that NLP-based systems are based on are biased. Additionally, it has been shown that bias in an underlying AI model is reproduced in applications based on that model). This can lead to biased decisions that run contrary to the goals of the European Pillar of Social Rights in relationship to work and employment, specifically Pillar 2 (Gender Equality), Pillar 3 (Equal Opportunity), Pillar 5 (Secure and Adaptable Employment) and the United Nations\u2019 (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), specifically SDG 5 (Gender Equality), SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth). It is therefore necessary to identify and mitigate biases that occur in applications used in a Human Resources Management (HRM) context. Addressing such concerns in an employment context is especially relevant, as most existing European studies on employment discrimination have indeed found that discrimination exists, both when considering individual diversity criteria and multiple criteria in intersectional analyses. In order to investigate and mitigate these biases, we apply this \"BIAS\"-project, for mitigating diversity biases of AI in the labor market. The chief technical objective of BIAS is the development of a proof-of-concept for an innovative technology based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Case Based Reasoning (CBR) for use in an HR recruitment use case.",

Through its computer science and AI experts, MAMMOth aims at addressing the associated scientific challenges by developing an innovative fairness-aware AI-data driven foundation that provides the necessary tools and techniques for the discovery and mitigation of (multi-)discrimination and ensures the accountability of AI-systems with respect to multiple protected attributes and for traditional tabular data and more complex network and visual data. \nThe project will actively engage with numerous communities of vulnerable and/or underrepresented groups in AI research right from the start, adopting a co-creation approach, to make sure that actual user needs and pains are at the centre of the research agenda and act as guidance to the project\u2019s activities. A social science-driven approach supported by social science and ethics experts will guide project research, and a science communication approach will increase the outreach of the outcomes.\nThe project aims to demonstrate through pilots the developed solutions into three relevant sectors of interest: a) finance/loan applications, b) identity verification systems, and c) academic evaluation.",

Despite the progress in the field, synthesizing a MOF currently requires tens to hundreds costly and time-consuming trial-and-error synthesis experiments because our ability to correlate the synthesis conditions with the desired MOF structure is very limited. To overcome this, we need to decode the mechanisms underlying MOF self-assembly, a highly complex non-equilibrium process covering a wide range of time- and length-scales, from the formation of the building units to nucleation and growth.\nIn MAGNIFY, my team and I will develop a multi-scale computational methodology that will decode the mechanisms underlying MOF self-assembly and predict synthesis conditions-structure relationships. This ambitious interdisciplinary project combines state-of-the-art multi-scale modelling techniques (enhanced sampling techniques, ab initio, atomistic and coarse-graining modelling), with machine-learning approaches to data analysis (dimensionality reduction and data clustering techniques) trained on new chemical descriptors. We will develop and validate our models in tandem with synthesis experiments. We will test our methodology by applying it to two central problems in MOF rational design: (i) determining how synthesis conditions (temperature, solvent, reactants, metal-to-ligand ratio, additives) drive the resulting MOF material's topology and point defects, as well as to (ii) tackling the very challenging task of predicting the synthesis conditions for producing brand new MOFs. This high-risk high-gain project will produce a breakthrough in the MOF field by enabling fast and resource-efficient MOF rational design and will open new research avenues in investigating the self-assembly of other materials and other complex processes happening through a large span of time- and length-scales.",

As such, they can be employed in gas sensors for detecting volatile organic compounds, environmental pollutants, and toxic gases, enabling important applications in environmental monitoring and industrial safety. Despite the incredible success of MOFs as a sensing strategy and sequestration agent, only macroscopic quantities of segregated compounds can be effectively sensed.

Quantum sensing is an emerging area of quantum information science that enables the measurement of physical properties using quantum objects (qubits). Quantum sensors are far more precise than their classical counterpart, potentially allowing them to probe a vast range of physical properties, from magnetic fields to gravity, with unprecedented sensitivity. In particular, molecular qubits represent one of the latest frontiers of spin-based quantum sensors, where long spin coherence times are combined with chemical versatility and the possibility to tailor molecular structures in order to tune the sensor\u2019s properties and tailor sensor-target interactions.

The main objectives are (A) to design experimentally-friendly protocols for quantum state preparation circumventing major existing bottlenecks (high number of repetitions, noise-induced barren plateaus...) and characterize broad families of states that can be prepared in a scalable way, (B) to develop a practical certification toolset amenable to near-term devices, with especial focus on the generation of certified randomness from a single NISQ device. The key idea is to use the hardness of many-body physics in a classical verifier-quantum prover interactive protocol.

They have potentially a tremendous long-term impact in areas such as quantum-many body physics and material science, and further afield in machine learning. The quantum many-body problems studied by condensed matter physicists are perhaps the most likely to yield early demonstrations of this potential. However, current and near-term intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices are limited in the number of operations that they can carry out before their performance is degraded by interactions with the environment. To take advantage of these platforms and to outperform classical computers, highly efficient and specialized quantum algorithms are required. The implementation and benchmarking of these basic algorithms on different quantum computing platforms is challenging and requires a detailed knowledge of the underlying physics. Our approach is to produce a ready-to-use, highly innovative software package based upon quantum tensor networks. The Quantum Tensor Engine (QTEngine) will provide a unifying framework for both quantum and classical algorithms. The QTEngine will serve as an engine to drive fast and easy implementation of quantum simulation, quantum machine learning, and optimization algorithms.

In contrast to conventional alloys and processing, alloys processed by AM are highly microstructurally heterogeneous. It is the aim of HeteroGenius4D to use the process-inherent conditions of highly precise, bottom-up AM approach to tailor these heterogeneous structures (e.g. grains/phases and their boundaries and orientations, chemical gradients, etc.) locally and spatially on various length scales. This is the basis for the novel design concept of heterogeneities-guided alloy design for AM. The potential to print local microstructures and properties in AM adds a 4th dimension to the design of 3D printed components; i.e. enables 4D printing.\n\nAM-processed metals with increasing degree of heterogeneity (from pure element over solid solutions with chemical gradients to multi-phase alloys with further phases and gradients) are studied systematically. The process-structure-properties-performance linkages are identified and quantified by combining high-throughput material synthesis (using extreme high-speed laser material deposition) and characterization with physics-based simulation tools, enabling a comprehensive integrated computational materials engineering (ICME) framework. The generated data serves as a basis for sophisticated data-driven (machine learning, ML) materials modelling and enables the establishment of an Experiments-ICME-ML optimal design approach for metal AM.

Perhaps the greatest mystery of modern ML---and arguably, one of the greatest mysteries of all of modern computer science---is the question of generalization: why do these immensely complex prediction rules successfully apply to future unseen instances?  Apart from the pure scientific curiosity it stimulates, I believe that this lack of understanding poses a significant obstacle to widening the applicability of ML to critical applications, like in healthcare or autonomous driving, where the cost of error is disastrous.  The broad goal of this project is to tackle the generalization mystery in the context of both statistical learning and reinforcement learning, focusing on optimization algorithms being the de facto contemporary standard in training learning models.  Our methodology points out to inherent shortcomings of widely accepted viewpoints with regard to generalization of optimization-based learning algorithms, and takes a crucially different approach that targets the optimization algorithm itself; building bottom-up from fundamental and tractable optimization models, we identify intrinsic properties and develop algorithmic methodologies that enable optimization to effectively generalize in modern statistical- and reinforcement-learning scenarios.

            "objective": "\"In modern industrial societies, myopia has become an important ocular health problem of young people, due to its increased incidence and associated complications, which pose a significant risk of blindness already in the middle life span. Current treatment options have limited effects with a maximum reduction of axial elongation by about 0.4 mm over several years, equivalent to a reduction in myopia by only about 1 D. Eye growth is controlled by an interplay of different biochemical pathways, one inhibitory (stimulated by image plane in front of the retina) and one stimulatory (image plane behind the retina). A novel future strategy would be to activate the inhibitory pathways rather than inhibit the growth stimulating pathways (standard target in most studies). At present, interventions to activate growth inhibition are poorly studied. The influence of environmental factors (spectral composition of ambient light) and gene-environment interactions (specific gene variants and their interaction with key lifestyle exposures) on eye growth and refractive development will be investigated. New pharmacological targets will be identified and tested, and biomarkers established to detect the onset of myopia at an earlier stage. It will be studied how choroidal hypoxia relates to choroidal thinning and axial eye growth and how it interacts with the metabolic processes in the retina and sclera. New measurement techniques will be developed that implement artificial intelligence algorithms to improve diagnostics in myopia studies, especially in the periphery of the visual field. The proposed intersectorial and interdisciplinary \"MyoTreat\" project (including anatomy, physiology, pharmacology, optics, and genetics) will train PhD students in myopia research and generate and disseminate novel research results. The ultimate scientific goal is to identify new strategies for myopia therapy through hypothesis-driven translational research in various animal models as well as in humans.\"",

However, there is huge room for improvement, as current clinical PET scanners are limited to spatial resolutions higher than 2.5 mm and temporal resolutions longer than 5 seconds. This hampers applications of PET for preclinical research and clinical diagnosis in small tissues or lesions and precludes real-time reconstruction of metabolic images. RETIMAGER is a proposal for a molecular imaging system with a ten-fold spatial and temporal improvement on the reconstructed image with respect to current PET devices. This will not only boost the quantitative performance, but it will enable new applications in cardiology, vascular oncology, oncology, neurology, and other areas. We will achieve this milestone by developing smart radiation detectors with non-conventional geometries that combine the advantages of both pixelated and monolithic detectors, the two dominant and seemingly incompatible technologies employed in PET scanners. Our new scanner will provide 0.25 mm pixel resolvability with time frames as short as 0.01 sec. By aggregating these blocks in a unique gantry self-adapting to the geometry of the field-of-view, RETIMAGER will achieve an unprecedented increase in sensitivity and in in vivo real-time imaging with submillimeter resolution. We will pair it with high-throughput data processing and AI tools to assess with a single tracer both perfusion and metabolism in preclinical and clinical models. In the long run, RETIMAGER\u2019s faster, lower dose, and less invasive molecular imaging technology will become a game-changer for understanding disease processes by unveiling new accurate image-based quantitative biomarkers, taking scientific and healthcare stakeholders a step closer to personalized precision medicine.",

            "objective": "Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a medical imaging technique that displays in vivo brain-wide metabolic processes. Prior to PET image acquisition, a tracer, labelled with a positron emitting isotope, is injected to the patient. This so-called radiotracer distributes over the body and accumulates in e.g. inflammatory tissue. \nTo date, the acquisiton of a PET image is limited to one tracer, thereby only displaying one metabolic process in the brain. However, the acquisition of two separate PET images acquired with different tracer simultaneously would give novel and unique insights in the communication between e.g. neurotransmitter systems. These insights could be used for the development of new drugs for e.g Alzheimer  patients and would increase the understanding of the healthy and diseased brain.\nThe acquisition of 'dual tracer' PET images can be achieved by combining two radiotracers with different properties: The first 'standard' radiotracer emits two photons that are recorded by the PET system, while the second 'non-standard' tracer emits two photons and an additional gamma ray. By identifying the additional gamma ray, the photon detections of the two tracers can be separated and two PET images can be reconstructed. \n'Dual tracer' PET image reconstruction yields challenges due to undesirable effect of photon detection. In this project, a machine learning algorithm will be trained to detect and correct for these effects. Moreover, the image acquired with the 'non-standard' tracer yields low image quality. A Convolutional Neural Network will be trained to denoise this PET image. \nIn the proposed project, a reconstruction algorithm for dual tracer PET based on machine learning techniques and resulting in two separate PET images with high image quality will be developed and implemented. The proposed project will demonstrate if dual tracer PET imaging has future potential and will help to understand the highly interactive neuronal communication in the brain.",

Interventions are often carried out during the latter stages of development, leading to low patient survival rates and poor quality of life. In 2022 a European Commission report stated that \"colonoscopy-based screening has higher sensitivity than testing for blood in stool, but it is less acceptable to participants\". At the same time, effective methods to treat polyps in the colon are limited. Current approaches are often associated with unsafe oncological margins and high complication rates, requiring life-changing surgery.\nEndoTheranostics will usher in a new era for screening colonoscopy, advancing the frontiers of medical imaging and robotics. A tip-growing or eversion robot with a sleeve-like structure will be created to extend deep into hollow spaces while perceiving the environment through multimodal imaging and sensing. It will also act as a conduit to transfer miniaturised instruments to the remote site within the colon for diagnosis and therapy (theranostics). With these capabilities, the system will be able to offer:\n1. painless colon cleansing in preparation for endoscopy;\n2. real-time polyp detection and tissue characterisation through AI-assisted multimodal imaging;\n3. effective removal of polyps by conveying a \"miniature mobile operating chamber\" equipped with microsurgical tools to the target through the lumen of the eversion robot.\nThe unique technical and clinical challenges will be tackled by the PIs, each bringing complementary skills, backed by their institutions with wide expertise and exceptional facilities. The synergy and added value evident in this team will lead to breakthroughs not possible through independent research. The outcomes of EndoTheranostics will revolutionise the theranostics of CRC, impacting the quality of life of millions of individuals. Ultimately it will launch a new era for endoluminal intervention with applications beyond medicine.",

The new generation hyperscale data centers offer a more energy-efficient alternative to conventional data centers but are limited by the current technology restrictions. Silicon photonics has been deemed to solve current bottlenecks for building green hyperscale data centers. However, this technology is challenged by the complicated and expensive fabrication methods of the laser sources, which represent 40% cost of the entire silicon transceiver market.  Using a simple fabrication method invented in our ERC Advanced project, we have designed a waveguide light source that can be fabricated onto the silicon-integrated platform with a single-step, straightforward, low-cost, low-temperature and scalable process that lowers the fabrication cost ~10 times compared to the state-of-the-art light sources. Such technologic breakthrough will push the implementation of silicon photonics in hyperscale data centers, allowing them to maintain a low energy footprint while meeting the ever-increasing bandwidth requirements of the growing big data societal challenge. Our project aims to further develop the novel technology and demonstrate its effectiveness for data center applications, to create the first-of-its-kind low-cost and scalable fabrication technology for the silicon photonics market, compatible with the current systems used in the industry. Furthermore, we will prepare and validate the business concept with value chain players, strengthen our IPR strategy, and prepare the commercialization to establish a start-up aiming at serving this significantly growing market (40% Compound Annual Growth Rate).",

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are the promising technologies for the emergency response applications (ERAs) to provide more efficient and faster services to save lives and reduce economic loss. This project aims to develop an innovative cooperative, connected and intelligent UAVs (CIUs) for ERAs, where sensing and computing resources, and flying information from individual UAV could be shared and exploited through effective communications and control of the CIUs. Specifically, context-aware and service-oriented UAV-to-everything (U2X) networks; robust cooperative UAV sensing and computing (CSC) schemes and intelligent cooperative UAV control strategies for ERAs will be investigated. An international inter-sector and inter-disciplinary consortium consisting of world leading academic institutions and prominent industrial partners is created to collaborate on developing novel CIU technologies in ERAs. Cutting-edge communications networks, edge computing, cooperative sensing, intelligent control, and machine learning related technologies will be investigated to tackle the associated challenges. With competent and complementary expertise of the partners and their extensive international research collaboration experience, this project will promote research innovation, foster knowledge sharing, enhance the potentials of participating researchers, and contribute to the European leadership in the UAVs, cooperative sensing and computing, multi-agent control, information and communications technology (ICT), and emergency response sectors. The developed CIU technologies and applications are not only applicable in various ERAs, like flooding, wildfires, and earthquake; but can also be readily extended to other applications, such as smart cities, public safety, agriculture, and the wider scientific community.",

The disease is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and the accumulation of protein aggregates in the remaining ones. The loss of these cells leads to a dopamine deficit in the striatum which causes the motor symptoms characteristic of PD and the general malfunction of the neuronal circuitry in the basal ganglia. The existing treatment for PD is dopamine replacement therapy with levodopa. This drug alleviates the motor symptoms but has a number of side effects, loses efficacy with time and does not address the cognitive decline caused by PD. In order to gain a better understanding of the disease and open new paths towards an effective treatment, the PARKSEQ project will use the latest advanced in single-cell RNA sequencing and in situ hybridization to determine which cell-type specific gene regulatory networks (GRNs) are affected by PD in the striatum. To this end, I will use single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to study post-mortem human striatum samples from PD and control subjects, under the supervision and guidance of Ana Mu\u00f1oz, a leading expert in PD and scRNA-seq studies. I will draw from my experience in Bioinformatics and in single cell data analysis to determine the cell types and subtypes existing in the human striatum. On each subtype, I will establish which genes are differentially expressed and, considering their co-expression, I will formulate putative altered GRNs. Then, during a secondment period, I will join Mats Nilsson laboratory to validate the scRNA-seq findings using in situ hybridization. Dr. Nilsson has advanced this technique making it possible to use verify the presence of over 100 genes simultaneously on intact tissue slices. This will enable me to verify the PD-induced alterations in the GRNs suggested by the scRNA-seq data.",

Indeed, Deep Reinforcement Learning (deep RL), which has recently led to AI breakthroughs in computer games, has been publicized as the learning-based approach to robotics. To date, however, deep RL studies focused on known and observable systems, where uncertainty was resolved by lengthy trial and error. Quickly learning to act in novel environments, as required for robotics, is not yet within our reach.\nThe crux of the matter is the tight coupling between perception and control under high uncertainty -- the robot must actively reduce uncertainty while also trying to solve the task; for complex and high-dimensional systems, we do not have a suitable algorithmic framework for this.\n\nIn this proposal, our overarching goal is to: \nDevelop the algorithmic framework of using deep learning in problems that tightly couple perception, planning, and control, for advancing robotic AI to reliably manipulate general objects in unstructured environments.\n\nTowards this end, we shall develop neural network representations of uncertainty, and algorithms that estimate uncertainty from data. We will develop theory and algorithms for decision making under uncertainty, bringing in a fresh perspective to the problem based on Bayesian reinforcement learning (Bayes-RL). These advances will allow us to study safety certificates for deep RL, and develop a general and practical methodology for learning-based robotic manipulation under uncertainty, validated on real robot experiments.

This offers big opportunities for automation in different sectors and daily life, but at the same time it brings risks for discrimination of minority and marginal population groups on the basis of the so-called protected attributes, like gender, race, and age. Despite the large body of research to date, the proposed methods work in limited settings, under very constrained assumptions, and do not reflect the complexity and requirements of real world applications. \nTo this end, the MAMMOth project focuses on multi-discrimination mitigation for tabular, network and multimodal data. Through its computer science and AI experts, MAMMOth aims at addressing the associated scientific challenges by developing an innovative fairness-aware AI-data driven foundation that provides the necessary tools and techniques for the discovery and mitigation of (multi-)discrimination and ensures the accountability of AI-systems with respect to multiple protected attributes and for traditional tabular data and more complex network and visual data. \nThe project will actively engage with numerous communities of vulnerable and/or underrepresented groups in AI research right from the start, adopting a co-creation approach, to make sure that actual user needs and pains are at the centre of the research agenda and act as guidance to the project\u2019s activities. A social science-driven approach supported by social science and ethics experts will guide project research, and a science communication approach will increase the outreach of the outcomes.\nThe project aims to demonstrate through pilots the developed solutions into three relevant sectors of interest: a) finance/loan applications, b) identity verification systems, and c) academic evaluation.",

In the criminal procedural field, AI is enhancing the efficiency of law enforcement authorities and criminal justice systems in both preventing and prosecuting crimes, through the streamlining of tasks like data analysis, evidence assessment, and crime prediction. Despite this accelerating trend, a conspicuous gap persists due to the lack of a clear and comprehensive legal framework at both national and supranational levels. An additional factor hindering a responsible and beneficial implementation of AI in the criminal procedural sector is that some technical characteristics of the AI prototypes developed so far (e.g. opacity) interfere with some criminal procedural principles and standards. The lack of dialogue between legal scholarship and scientific community prevents the identification of suitable technical solutions. Given this scenario, managing the legal and ethical implications of AI in the criminal justice system proves to be a prohibitive challenge. The aim of FUTURE is twofold: to support national legislators across the EU in the regulation of artificial intelligence in criminal procedure, while fostering a harmonized approach to the subject; to bridge the gap between the technical and the legal community, ensuring the compliance of AI systems implemented in the criminal procedural field with its principles and safeguards. To achieve these objectives, FUTURE will firstly employ the legal comparison method in a groundbreaking manner: it will be applied on a comprehensive legal and empirical data set, covering all EU Member States\u2019 jurisdictions. Secondly, it will bridge the expertise of legal and computer science professionals, giving them the first tangible chance to investigate the technical issues obstructing the use of AI in criminal proceedings and to assess the feasibility of technical solutions.",

During the last two decades, Neuromorphic computing has been implemented on electronics, with the most important circuit element capable of best mimicking neurons and synapses that is the memristor. Yet, constructing a highly interconnected networks of memristors to resemble biological architecture requires metal wires with extremely scaled area that results in an immense heat generation and power consumption, hindering the neuromorphic electronics development. Recently the new field of neuromorphic photonics has attracted a lot of interest as a valid alternative. In neuromorphic photonics the network connections are made of optical waveguide that provides inherent parallelism, ultra low latency, and almost zero power dissipation. However neuromorphic photonic will only meet its expectation as a groundbreaking technology when an Ideal photonic memristor is available. The ideal photonic memristor (currently missing) should adjust the amplitude of transmitted light in a non-volatile and analog manner, not via light absorption but through light phase change, to minimize the synapsis insertion losses. In this project I will demonstrate the low loss photonic memristor by innovative exploitation of energy band alignment and refractive index modulation of 2-Dimensional (2D) material heterostructures. I will embed the 2D heterostructure within a photonic integrated Mach- Zehnder Interferometer to showcase the non-volatile optical phase shifting with 1-10 fJ energy consumption per bit. This project will conduct interdisciplinary research across light-matter interaction, that requires contributions from materials science, physics, photonics and electronics. Positive outcome of this action will lead to a breakthrough in the development of neuromorphic photonics, thus a revolution in various aspects of smart human societies that rely on high throughput data computation.",

However, to achieve even greater efficiency, NC requires hardware that also mimics the behavior of neurons and synapses. Memristive synapses are pivotal components in emulating the synaptic plasticity observed in biological neural networks. Nevertheless, the implementation of spintronic memristors compatible with state-of-the-art computing is challenging due to the large current density needed,  the long switching times present in ferromagnets and the need of small applied magnetic fields.   The objective of this project is then to design, fabricate, and characterize field-free memristive synapses using Gd-based ferrimagnets. We will use two approaches: all-optical magnetic switching and the use of multiferroics to switch the magnetization by the application of electric fields. By taking advantage of the unique properties of ferrimagnets, ultrafast and energy efficient magnetic switching, we aim to develop highly efficient synapses that exhibit memristive behavior without the need for an external magnetic field.",

Adoption of AI-based support systems in such applications is however minimal, chiefly due to the difficulty of assessing their assumptions, limitations and intentions. In order to realise the promise of AI for individuals, society and economy, people should feel they can trust AIs in terms of reliability, capacity to understand the human\u2019s needs, and guarantees that they are genuinely aiming at helping them. TANGO will develop the theoretical basis and computational framework for hybrid decision support systems (HDSS) in which humans and machines are aligned in terms of values and goals, know their respective strengths, and work together to reach an optimal decision. To this end, TANGO will develop: 1) A cognitive theory of mutual understanding and hybrid decision making, of intuitive vs deliberative approaches to decision making and of how they affect our trust in human and AI teammates. 2) Cognition-aware explainable AIs implementing synergistic human-machine interaction, enabling machines to determine what information a specific decision maker (e.g., layperson vs expert) needs, or does not need, to reach an informed decision. 3) A \"Human-in-the-loop\" co-evolution of human decision making and machine learning models building on bi-directional, explanation-augmented interlocution. The TANGO framework will be evaluated on four high impact use cases, namely supporting: i) women during pregnancy and postpartum, ii) surgical teams in intraoperative decision making, iii) loan officers and applicants in credit lending decision processes, and iv) public policy makers in designing incentives and allocating funds. Success in these case studies will establish TANGO as the framework of reference for developing a new generation of synergistic AI systems, and will strengthen the leadership of Europe in human-centric AI.",

With their advent, much research has been devoted to finding them a first practical application. Focus on optimization, quantum chemistry and machine learning has been intense, and the developments are closely monitored by governments and industry alike. Variational algorithms in a classical-quantum feedback loop and adiabatic algorithms have been the dominant paradigm. However, important bottle-necks remain that severely maim the performance of NISQ devices and the field yearns for a novel approach.\nFINE-TEA-SQUAD, FIrst NEar-TErm ApplicationS of QUAntum Devices, proposes a radically new vision: to develop a unifying framework that will yield the first practical applications of NISQ devices. The main objectives are (A) to design experimentally-friendly protocols for quantum state preparation circumventing major existing bottlenecks (high number of repetitions, noise-induced barren plateaus...) and characterize broad families of states that can be prepared in a scalable way, (B) to develop a practical certification toolset amenable to near-term devices, with especial focus on the generation of certified randomness from a single NISQ device. The key idea is to use the hardness of many-body physics in a classical verifier-quantum prover interactive protocol. This approach will overcome the existing limitations of current approaches: it will be both easy to prepare and easy to verify (C) to overcome current hardware scalability limitations by combining several NISQ nodes into a small quantum network, and develop the appropriate theoretical framework to efficiently tailor and run quantum algorithms on them.",

This offers enormous possibilities for improvements in human economy and wellbeing. However, it also poses strong risks that are difficult to assess and control by humans. The trend towards increased autonomy conveys augmented problems concerning reliability, resilience, and trust for autonomous robots in open worlds. The essence of the problem can be traced to robots suffering from a lack of understanding of what is going on and a lack of awareness of their role in it. This is a problem that artificial intelligence approaches based on machine learning are not addressing well. Autonomous robots do not fully understand their open environments, their complex missions, their intricate realizations, and the unexpected events that affect their performance. An improvement in the capability to understand of autonomous robots is needed. This project tries to provide a solution to this need in the form of 1) a theory of understanding, 2) a theory of awareness, 3) reusable software assets to apply these theories in real robots, and 4) three demonstrations of its capability to a) augment resilience of drone teams, b) augment flexibility of manufacturing robots, and c) augment human alignment of social robots. In summary, we will develop a cognitive architecture for autonomous robots based on a formal concept of understanding, supporting value-oriented situation understanding and self-awareness to improve robot flexibility, resilience and explainability.",

For the first time, chemical abundances of stellar atmospheres will be linked to the positions and motions of stars over the entire sky. Taking advantage of the unprecedented wealth of chemo-dynamical data, the EMMY project aims to tackle outstanding questions about the mutual interplay of different evolutionary mechanisms in the Galactic disc, including the influence of the Milky Way\u2019s satellite galaxies, along with secular evolutionary processes. Specifically, the EMMY project aims to: 1) map chemo-dynamical inhomogeneities in the Galactic disc; 2) determine the extent to which the observed inhomogeneities can be attributed to internal processes, such as the actions of the spiral arms or the bar; 3) constrain the role of external influences, such as satellite interactions, on the disc evolution. The objectives will be assessed through an optimised Galactic cartography, which will link inhomogeneities in stellar density, velocity, chemistry; observational results will be then compared to cosmological simulations and chemical evolution models, to constrain spiral arms formation scenarios and disc heating processes. The multidisciplinary nature of the project is strong, combining interdisciplinary knowledge of astronomy, physics, statistics, data mining, and big data analysis. The results of the proposed project are expected to give a cohesive, statistically robust, accurate, and informative picture of the physical processes in the Galactic disc, which have the potential to represent an important contribution to our understanding of the Galaxy and its place in the Universe.",

Designing such novel electronics needs the development of cost-effective, fast and reliable materials with tunable functionality.

The idea is to utilise the fundamental understanding of multi-dimensional (electrical, optical, mechanical and magnetic) control of NDR which is not explored yet and is possible in TbMnO3. NDR enables a two-terminal device to display self-oscillations due to applied electrical spikes. The spiking electrical currents could be used to govern the behaviour of these oscillations and emulating the leaky, integrate, and fire behaviour of biological neurons. Once such a performance is achieved, the device will further be integrated into oscillatory neural networks array for demonstration of complex computing tasks such as image recognition and imitating human behaviour.    \n\nThe project will unite the applicant\u2019s expertise in synaptic devices and materials engineering with the extensive experience of the host-labs in thin-film and neuromorphic devices.

Neuromorphic computing, a brain-inspired approach, addresses this need by radically changing the processing of information. Although neuromorphic electrical computing systems offer advantages in terms of CMOS implementations and scalability, they inherit limitations of conventional electronics such as low energy-efficiency, high latency and low bandwidth density. Besides, such systems often require robust security layers for e.g., safety-critical applications. Security layers based on memory-stored secret keys are prone to several types of memory-accessing attacks. Therefore, silicon hardware approaches for security primitives such as physical unclonable functions (PUFs) are currently investigated because of their absence of long-term digital memory storage. Although electronic PUFs have received major attention thanks to their native CMOS implementation, for secure authentication they are prone to machine learning and side-channel attacks due to their CMOS technology.\nThe NEUROPULS project aims to build next-generation low-power and secure edge-computing systems by developing novel photonic computing architectures and security layers based on photonic PUFs in augmented silicon photonics CMOS-compatible platforms. The integration of emerging non-volatile phase change materials for synapses/neurons and III-V materials for on-chip spiking sources, for the first time, will allow to build novel neuromorphic accelerators featuring RISC-V compliant interfaces for smooth adoption and programmability.

Although its physics is not yet fully understood, resistive switching devices (called memristors) are promising as efficient artificial synapses in neuro-inspired computing systems. However practical challenges exist. Current devices excel in only a few of the performance metrics necessary for circuit and system integration. Moreover, they exhibit non-idealities causing neuromorphic systems using these devices to have low performance. The project will address this key issue by pursuing device-system co-optimization across four objectives, aiming to engineer a single \"hero\" resistive switching technology with all the desired metrics. Aim 1 will develop resistive switching devices based on a new class of materials with broad compositional space, called high entropy oxides. Promising compositions will be fabricated in a high throughput fashion. In Aim 2, a proposed characterization method via a state-of-the-art mid-infrared laser will help understand in-operando the filamentary switching at nanoscale and uncover the physical mechanisms behind its non-idealities. The fabrication and characterization will iteratively target a broad range of performance metrics. Some metrics can only be quantified across a population of devices, so Aim 3 will integrate the optimized devices on transistor circuitry for benchmarking at scale. Aim 4 targets the applicability of these devices to next generation neuromorphic systems for machine learning training. Preliminary work on a multi-layer neural network validated this concept and indicated the need for co-optimization, as proposed.

This switching, in which the two terminal resistance of a device is controlled by current is at the heart of emerging technologies such as resistive random access memory and neuromorphic computation. These technologies promise to revolutionize artificial neural networks and mimic the behavior of biological brains, triggering a race the for optimal RS materials.\n\nIn Mott insulators electrical currents can change resistance by orders-of-magnitude due to an insulator-metal phase transition. The volatility of switching in Mott insulators can be adjusted by several tuning parameters, enabling both memory devices and neuron-like functionalities. Moreover, in terms of fundamental switching timescales and energy efficiency, Mott insulators may have very significant advantages over other RS mechanisms. These unique properties have made Mott insulators prominent candidate materials for RS. However, the physical mechanisms behind RS in these materials are not well understood and often uncontrollable, hampering realization of their full potential. \n\nWe suggest two main routes towards Mott-insulator-based RS with ultrahigh energy efficiency. The first is by switching purely in the electronic sector while minimizing structural distortions. Thus, the low heat capacity of electrons may enable switching with a fraction of the energy required in an insulator-metal transition coupled to a structural transition. The second is absorption of latent heat and/or elastic energy from the surroundings of the switching volume, thus reducing the externally supplied power consumption. Our aim is to use defects, doping and strain engineering  to understand and tune RS mechanisms, and develop novel functionalities with ultra-low energy consumption.",

Yet, DNN training at scale poses severe challenges to standard paradigms in distributed computing; existing distributed training approaches and their practical implementations, via training libraries such as PyTorch or TensorFlow, often suffer from major distribution bottlenecks, which can significantly reduce computational efficiency, leading to wasted time, money, and energy.\n\nThe FastML proof-of-concept (PoC) project will tackle this efficiency challenge head-on, by introducing a distributed training framework that will significantly reduce or even eliminate the overheads of parallelization for practical distributed training workloads, in common usage scenarios. FastML\u2019s distinctive feature is leveraging the algorithmic and software techniques developed by our ERC Starting Grant, in order to reduce distribution overheads at scale without impacting training convergence or model accuracy. FastML stands in contrast to current distribution techniques, which rely on hardware overprovisioning\u2013essentially, providing very fast but also very expensive interconnects between the computing nodes. As such, FastML can bring significant infrastructure and running cost improvements to its users, as well as lowering the cost and hardware entry barrier to training accurate machine learning models. The PoC will design and develop the FastML software library to target industry-relevant workloads via pilot projects jointly with our industrial partners.

Most of its successes are achieved by increasingly large neural networks that are trained on massive data sets.

The huge model sizes also pose computational challenges for algorithms that aim to address issues with features that are critical in real-world applications like fairness, adversarial robustness, and interpretability. The high demand of neural networks for vast amounts of data further limits their utility for solving highly relevant tasks in biomedicine, economics, or natural sciences.\nTo democratize deep learning and to broaden its applicability, we have to find ways to learn small-scale models. With this end in view, we will promote sparsity at multiple stages of the machine learning pipeline and identify models that are scaleable, resource- and data-efficient, robust to noise, and provide insights into problems. To achieve this, we need to overcome two challenges: the identification of trainable sparse network structures and the de novo optimization of small-scale models.\nThe solutions that we propose combine ideas from statistical physics, complex network science, and machine learning. Our fundamental innovations rely on the insight that neural networks are a member of a cascade model class that we made analytically tractable on random graphs. Advancing our derivations will enable us to develop novel parameter initialization, regularization, and reparameterization methods that will compensate for the missing implicit benefits of overparameterization for learning.

Several trials are acquiring the clinical evidence to support the shift from radical prostatectomy to PCa focal therapy, considering the multifocal aspect of PCa and the need to preserve the surrounding anatomical structures. Key to focal therapies is the ability to accurately and repeatably positioning the ablation device in the PCa area and to achieve the minimal tissue removal that satisfies the safety margins around the tumor and leaves the other structures untouched. The problem of accurately positioning a biopsy needle in the PCa area has been solved by the PROST project, thus we want to build on this capability to set the basis of PCa focal therapy. To achieve this goal, PROFTH will address three main objectives: 1. definition of the joint requirements between clinical needs, capabilities of the current ablation devices and positioning accuracy of PROST; 2. development of the digital twin of the pelvic area to integrate the medical information of the patient; and 3. develop a planning algorithm that will compute the position of the ablation devices in the patient PCa.

Spintronics has gained significant importance in data storage applications, and spintronics nanodevices such as MTJs have recently emerged as promising candidates for neuromorphic computing due to their robustness, multifunctionalities and compatibility with compatibility to metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology. They hold strong appeal for the development of artificial synapses and neurons that mimic their biological counterparts due to their low power consumption and fast switching compared to traditional transistors. In addition, the nanoscale size of spintronic devices allows for the creation of large neural networks. The integration of memory and processing in these devices has the potential to revolutionize computational systems and strongly reduce energy consumption while increasing computational speed.",

Despite their success, DL methods do not obey most of the wisdoms of statistical learning theory, and the vast majority of the current DL techniques mainly stand as poorly understood black-box algorithms. \n\nEven though DL theory has been a very active research field in the past few years, there is a significant gap between the current theory and practice: (i) the current theory often becomes vacuous for models with large number of parameters (which is typical in DL), and (ii) it cannot capture the interaction between data, architecture, training algorithm and its hyper-parameters, which can have drastic effects on the overall performance. Due to this lack of theoretical understanding, designing new DL systems has been dominantly performed by ad-hoc, 'trial-and-error' approaches.\n\nThe main objective of this proposal is to develop a mathematically sound and practically relevant theory for DL, which will ultimately serve as the basis of a software library that provides practical tools for DL practitioners. In particular, (i) we will develop error bounds that closely reflect the true empirical performance, by explicitly incorporating the dynamics aspect of training, (ii) we will develop new model selection, training, and compression algorithms with reduced time/memory/storage complexity, by exploiting the developed theory.\n\nTo achieve the expected breakthroughs, we will develop a novel theoretical framework, which will enable tight analysis of learning algorithms in the lens of dynamical systems theory. The outcomes will help relieve DL from being a black-box system and avoid the heuristic design process. We will produce comprehensive open-source software tools adapted to all popular DL libraries, and test the developed algorithms on a wide range of real applications arising in computer vision, audio/music/natural language processing.",

Hardware implementation of digital DL can help reduce energy usage, but the Von Neumann architecture of current DL has hindered its practical realization. In contrast, the brain exhibits energy-efficient multiscale spatiotemporal processing. Biologically plausible (BiP) frameworks have emerged as alternatives to mainstream DL. These methods use bottom-up and top-down signals, incorporating feedforward and feedback mechanisms, and local objectives instead of global error. Recently, I demonstrated that a BiP opto-analog hardware can achieve competitive performance compared to digital DL for feedforward networks. However, transformers, the backbone of current DL, are challenging to implement due to the input-dependent quadratic complexity in the transformer's attention. This project leverages the multiscale dynamics in the primary vision system to explore BiP architectures for transformers.\n\nThe project is hosted at the University of T\u00fcbingen under Matthias Bethge and Thomas Euler, who have a long-standing effort in the system identification of mouse retina via DL. The project has three objectives. First, I will extract top-down information from neural recordings of ganglion cells in the mouse retina, focusing on unique spatiotemporal features that maximally activate specific cell types. Next, I will combine top-down signals with bottom-up models of the retina using recurrent architectures with linear complexity and compare their performance in classification tasks to a vision transformer for the retina. Lastly, I propose a BiP transformer with local weight updates. I will examine the robustness of models under data distribution shifts and noise injection. A positive outcome of the project will address energy and cost issues of AI and help me progress my academic career in this interdisciplinary field.",

Much of the safe robot decision-making literature today focuses on explicit safety constraints defined in the robot state and input space. However, in practical applications, robots are often required to infer semantics-grounded safe actions from perception input.

IoT5.0, an Artificial Intelligence (AI) -assisted Internet of Things, could even more benefit society, as the devices could even learn how to provide more value. But the ubiquitous connectivity comes at a cost. Security levels have to rise tremendously to ensure a network stays secure and safe for humans. This additional effort often is a burden for small and medium sized enterprises as the complexity and security demands of such systems rise faster than available resources. This is especially dangerous as a single corrupted, malicious device can result in the exploitation of the entire network of connected devices by an attacker. Consequently, RESILIENT TRUST focuses on end-to-end security of IoT processing chains with a focus on strong exploitation for SMEs. This vision will be realized by developing specialized hardware to establish TRUST in-between a network and a wall of RESILIENCE even against new attack methods such as post quantum attacks and AI based attacks. The architecture of the secure processing chain will be carefully built after threat modelling, asset identification, risk analysis, security objectives and requirements definition. Consequently, RESILIENT TRUST will address and significantly mitigate these major risks to enable IoT5.0. That way this project will be a driver for sustainable development and the generation of convenience and wealth. A solution is proposed to ensure end-to-end security by boosting RESILIENCE and TRUST along different key supply chains of IoT device",

The societal and economic impact of IoT/ML systems in urban and suburban areas significantly outpaces the one in rural areas due to a limited reach of connectivity infrastructure. To reverse further widening of the urban-rural gap, we need to bring efficient and affordable IoT/ML solutions to deep rural areas, reaching out to applications and use cases ranging from wildlife management, rural tourism, livestock monitoring, water and air pollution control, and others. By identifying main gaps in connectivity and affordable data analytics and through interleaved research, development and validation in a real-world setting, REMARKABLE will address the challenge of bringing IoT and data analytics systems a step closer to seamless, energy efficient and secure deployment in rural ares. The consortium composed of six European academic partners, five companies and five associated partners representing leading academic groups from Africa, will focus on research, development, innovation and demonstration across five use cases with six demonstration sites located in rural areas across the European and African continent. The inter-disciplinary nature of the programme provides a unique opportunity for investigation of smart sensing, IoT and data science technology from non-traditional, holistic perspectives leading to new scientific achievements and innovations. Project outputs like smart IoT sensors and devices, rural IoT digital twining platforms, ultra wide-area IoT networks, novel data analytics models and architectures will find their routes to the market via active industrial partners. The project will impact EU workforce market via new interdisciplinary skills for young contributors and form new long-lasting networks of European and African institutions in the area of sensing, IoT, big data analytics and rural entrepreneurship.",

Current treatments merely alleviate symptoms temporarily, but are unable to impede the progression of the disease. Clearly, PD research has hit a wall, and new approaches are needed. \n\nRecent discoveries of the involvement of the peripheral immune system in PD have sparked a groundbreaking proposition by BICEPS: PD must be considered a systemic disease with an immune response involving both brain and periphery. Thus, to revolutionize PD research, we must shift away from the neuro-centric approach of past decades and extend our focus to studying the immune system outside the brain. Furthermore, recent advancements, such as systems biology and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven data mining, diagnosis, and drug development, hold significant promise for advancing PD research.\n\nTherefore, BICEPS is uniting PD researchers, immunologists, and experts in AI and systems biology from leading European academic institutions, startup companies, and established pharmaceutical firms into a unique consortium. The primary objective is to train a new generation of PD researchers with interdisciplinary expertise in these fields.\n\nThis ambitious goal will be realized through an intensive training program that encompasses cutting-edge methodologies, encourages innovation, nurtures transferable skills, and provides immersive, hands-on research experiences. Thereby, the BICEPS network aims to shape the future of PD research by adopting a fresh perspective and expediting the development of diagnostics and therapies for PD, with a particular focus on the immune system.",

The disease is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and the accumulation of protein aggregates in the remaining ones. The loss of these cells leads to a dopamine deficit in the striatum which causes the motor symptoms characteristic of PD and the general malfunction of the neuronal circuitry in the basal ganglia. The existing treatment for PD is dopamine replacement therapy with levodopa. This drug alleviates the motor symptoms but has a number of side effects, loses efficacy with time and does not address the cognitive decline caused by PD. In order to gain a better understanding of the disease and open new paths towards an effective treatment, the PARKSEQ project will use the latest advanced in single-cell RNA sequencing and in situ hybridization to determine which cell-type specific gene regulatory networks (GRNs) are affected by PD in the striatum. To this end, I will use single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to study post-mortem human striatum samples from PD and control subjects, under the supervision and guidance of Ana Mu\u00f1oz, a leading expert in PD and scRNA-seq studies. I will draw from my experience in Bioinformatics and in single cell data analysis to determine the cell types and subtypes existing in the human striatum. On each subtype, I will establish which genes are differentially expressed and, considering their co-expression, I will formulate putative altered GRNs. Then, during a secondment period, I will join Mats Nilsson laboratory to validate the scRNA-seq findings using in situ hybridization. Dr. Nilsson has advanced this technique making it possible to use verify the presence of over 100 genes simultaneously on intact tissue slices. This will enable me to verify the PD-induced alterations in the GRNs suggested by the scRNA-seq data.",

Cardiovascular disease is a major cause of death and morbidity worldwide. The causes of MI are highly complex involving genetic, lifestyle and environmental factors. Whilst much research effort has been invested in attempting to decipher these factors, clinical applications of findings are disappointingly few. We will harness four -omic datasets (whole genome, transcriptomic, metabolomic and proteomic data) on 1000 highly phenotyped samples of the Maltese Acute Myocardial Infarction (MAMI) Study. These were collected from cases, controls and relatives of cases (including 80 families) with meticulous attention to preanalytical variables. We will identify intermediate phenotypes associated with risk of MI and its associated risk factors. Using a combination of approaches including extreme phenotype and family-based approaches we will identify variants which robustly influence these intermediate phenotypes. The genes thus identified are potential drug targets that influence risk of MI via an intermediate phenotype and are applicable across all populations. They will be validated through various approaches including computational analysis, (using Mendelian randomisation and 10 year follow-up data), and functional work that includes using zebrafish as an animal model. Machine learning algorithms will be used to analyse the multi-layered data to identify novel biomarkers and risk algorithms, including polygenic risk scores, for early risk prediction in the clinic. Quantitative targeted proteomic assays will be developed for further validation in other cohorts facilitating clinical use. Besides the increase in knowledge on the molecular etiology of MI, this powerful integrated strategy will bring rapid clinical translation of unprecedented multi-omic data.",

However, implementing such algorithms in low-power devices remains a challenge due to the energy inefficiency that comes from separating logic and memory in current electronic systems. For the past 10 years, research groups have been developing alternative electronic components and systems, such as brain inspired computing architectures and novel resistive memory technologies to address this design bottleneck. The critical feature for these new technologies to perform at their best is a very high-density, reliable, non-volatile memory with infinite endurance. This ideal memory does not exist today, and it is unlikely it will ever exist. This project takes inspiration from the insect\u2019s nervous system. The general aim of DIVERSE is to enable learning from a very limited volume of noisy data based on imperfect, limited density, low endurance, resistive memories. Unlike digital systems, insects are not very good at performing precise calculations, but they excel at making extremely energy-efficient real time decisions by combining sensory data recorded in noisy environments.

Conventional digital electronics and the associated computer architecture is unable to meet these stringent requirements with sub-ms latency inference and a sub-10W power budget, using convolution neural networks (CNNs) on benchmarks such as ImageNet classification. HYBRAIN\u2019s vision is to realize a pathway for a radical new technology with ultrafast (~1 microsecond) and energy-efficient (~1 watt) edge AI inference based on a world-first, brain-inspired hybrid architecture of integrated photonics and unconventional electronics. The deeply entwined memory and processing like in the mammalian brain obviates the need to shuttle around synaptic weights. The most stringent latency bottleneck in CNNs is in the initial convolution layers. Our approach will take advantage of the ultrahigh throughput and low latency of photonic convolutional processors (PCPs) employing novel phase-change materials in these initial layers to radically speed up processing. Their output is processed using cascaded electronic linear and nonlinear classifier layers, based on memristive (phase-change memory) crossbar arrays and dopant network processing units, respectively. HYBRAIN\u2019s science-towards-technology breakthrough brings together the world\u2019s top research groups from academia and industry in complementary technology platforms. Each of these platforms is already highly promising, but by integrating them, HYBRAIN will have a transformative effect of overcoming existing barriers of latency and energy consumption and will enable a whole new spectrum of edge AI applications throughout society.",

A key enabler of its progress is the ability to train large, highly-accurate Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in a distributed fashion, across tens to thousands of different computational nodes. Yet, DNN training at scale poses severe challenges to standard paradigms in distributed computing; existing distributed training approaches and their practical implementations, via training libraries such as PyTorch or TensorFlow, often suffer from major distribution bottlenecks, which can significantly reduce computational efficiency, leading to wasted time, money, and energy.\n\nThe FastML proof-of-concept (PoC) project will tackle this efficiency challenge head-on, by introducing a distributed training framework that will significantly reduce or even eliminate the overheads of parallelization for practical distributed training workloads, in common usage scenarios. FastML\u2019s distinctive feature is leveraging the algorithmic and software techniques developed by our ERC Starting Grant, in order to reduce distribution overheads at scale without impacting training convergence or model accuracy. FastML stands in contrast to current distribution techniques, which rely on hardware overprovisioning\u2013essentially, providing very fast but also very expensive interconnects between the computing nodes. As such, FastML can bring significant infrastructure and running cost improvements to its users, as well as lowering the cost and hardware entry barrier to training accurate machine learning models. The PoC will design and develop the FastML software library to target industry-relevant workloads via pilot projects jointly with our industrial partners. In addition, we will perform an in-depth market study, devise intellectual property and go-to-market strategies, and produce a minimally-viable product (MVP), which will be demonstrated to potential customers and investors.",

Instead of manually creating complex software, engineers now use automatically generated deep neural networks (DNNs) in critical financial, medical and transportation systems, obtaining previously unimaginable results.\n\nDespite their remarkable achievements, DNNs remain opaque. We do not understand their decision making and cannot prove their correctness - thus risking potentially devastating outcomes. For example, it has been shown that DNNs that navigate autonomous aircraft with the goal of avoiding collisions could produce incorrect turning advisories. Thus, the lack of formal guarantees regarding DNN behavior is preventing their safe deployment in critical systems, and could jeopardize human lives. Consequently, there is a crucial need to ensure that DNNs operate correctly.\n\nRecent and exciting developments in formal verification allow us to automatically reason about DNNs. However, this is a nascent technology, which currently only scales to medium-sized DNNs - whereas real-world systems are much larger. Additionally, it is unclear how to apply this technology in practice. I propose to bridge this crucial gap through the development of novel, scalable and groundbreaking techniques for verifying the correctness of large DNNs, and by applying them to real systems of interest. I will do this by (1) developing search-space pruning techniques, which will enable us to verify larger DNNs; (2) creating novel abstraction-refinement techniques, which will allow us to scale to even larger DNNs; and (3) identifying new kinds of relevant specifications and key domains where DNNs are used, demonstrating the verification of real-world DNNs.\n\nThis project will result in a sound and expressive framework for automatically reasoning about DNNs, orders of magnitude larger than is possible today. This framework will ensure the safety and correctness of DNNs deployed in critical systems, greatly benefiting users and society.",

Our approach is to produce a ready-to-use, highly innovative software package based upon quantum tensor networks.

The project execution is based on 4 pillars, delivering: (a) the Implementation of new 6G enablers, complementary to existing ones being developed in SNS Phase 1 projects, (b) A truly scalable and 3GPP compliant Federation solution that provides access to heterogeneous resources and devices from all Europe, (c) A Federated AI plane aligned with AIaaS and MLOPS paradigms, which promotes a collaborative approach to AI research which benefits immensely from scaling-up datasets and models and (d) a commonly adopted Experimentation Plane, which offers common workflows to experimenters.",

In 6G, several key technical enablers are envisioned: i) mmWave and THz frequencies electromagnetic with extremely large bandwidths, and extremely large antenna arrays; ii) reconfigurable intelligent surfaces that control the propagation environment; and iii) machine learning to solve problems for which mathematical models are not sufficient. As location-aware communication (i.e., to optimize network efficiency and communication capacity by exploiting location, map, and trajectory information) is already a part of 5G, we expect that the 6G key enablers will also lead to high-accuracy sensing and localization and, in turn, improve communication quality. The goal of this project is to develop integrated sensing, localization, and communication systems for 6G, and the project comprises the following 3 work packages (WPs). In WP1, joint parameter estimation methods for the 6G channel are studied, and low-complexity methods will be developed based on the inherent high resolution of the 6G channel. By exploiting the estimated channel parameters of 6G signals, novel methods for estimating user state as well as sensing the time-varying propagation environment will be developed in WP2. We will design methods to use sensing and localization information from WP2 for initial beam search, beamspace processing, beam alignment, and power allocation in WP3. In doing so, we address several of the fundamental challenges in 6G communications and high-accuracy sensing and localization.",

There is a continuous debate regarding whether AI is worthy of trust. The EU AI HLEG has defined that trustworthy AI systems should be lawful, ethical and robust. To translate it into actionable practices, provision of explainability, fairness and privacy is crucial. A considerable volume of research has been conducted in the areas of explainable AI, fair AI and privacy-preserving AI. However, the current research efforts to tackle the three challenges are fragmented and have culminated in a variety of solutions with heterogeneous, non-interoperable, or even conflicting capabilities.  The ambitious vision of HarmonicAI is to build a human-machine collaborative multi-objective design framework to foster coherently explainable, fair and privacy-preserving AI for digital health. HarmonicAI draws together proven experts in AI, health care, IoT, data science, privacy, cyber security, software engineering, HCI and industrial design with an underlying common aim to develop concrete technical and operational guidelines for AI practitioners to design human-centered, domain-specific, requirement-oriented trustworthy AI solutions, accelerating the scalable deployment of AI-powered digital health services and offering assurance to the public that AI in digital health is being developed and used in an ethical and trustworthy manner.",

Deep learning applications usually require vast amounts of computing resources but microelectronics are encountering physically fundamental bottlenecks in speed, energy consumption, heating, and interconnect delay, which can no longer be resolved by scaling. The end of Moore\u2019s law urgently calls for the introduction of new devices, new integration technologies, and new architectures to efficiently accelerate deep learning applications. Recently, optical neural networks (ONNs) based on photonic integrated circuits have shown great potential as an emerging computing architecture beyond von Neumann and Moore to overcome the bottlenecks in their microelectronics counterparts. Yet the ONN concepts and demonstrations so far are encountering severe obstacles such as limited calculation precision, repeatability, scalability, and compatibility with microelectronics. These obstacles are deeply rooted in the analogue computing architecture of the existing ONNs: insufficient signal-to-noise ratio due to accumulated noise and crosstalk in the system. \nDOLORES aims to explore and develop a radically new digital optical computing platform to create a new class of processors, namely a digital optical neural network (DONN) processor, that is fundamentally different from any ONN scheme and solves the aforementioned obstacles. Integrating the best of photonics and electronics, DOLORES is expected to revolutionize optical computing, and in the long-term vision enable new possibilities that are barely supported by today\u2019s computing hardware.

Although memristors rose as a potential synapse to solve the density challenge in a memristive crossbar, the scalability of the crossbar is limited by its power dissipation and chip area. To contribute to low power dissipation, I focus on improving the energy efficiency of the synapses (non-filamentary category) and neurons, which are the fundamental constituents of the neural network-enabled IOTs. The energy efficiency of the synapses will be improved by applying fast switching pulses on the bulk-based synapses that result in low switching currents. The energy efficiency of the neurons will be improved by taking advantage of the FDSOI28nm technology node by which the neurons are designed. A dedicated PCB will be designed, assembled and mounted that house both the synapses, and the neurons, which will be energy-efficiently used to recognize digits or letters by unsupervised learning rule.",

In Europe alone, more than 340,000 people are diagnosed with colorectal cancer each year. While treatment options of CRC have expanded over the last decades, the survival rates of patients suffering from advanced-stage cancers remain poor. Stemness of neoplastic cells has been proposed as a major factor in treatment resistance and high relapse rates, however, drugs targeting stem cell signaling pathways in cancer are still lacking today. We propose developing and validating a new drug discovery platform based on patient-derived organoids (PDOs) and machine learning-assisted phenotypic target validation and drug discovery. Using this platform, we have previously shown that we can identify a broad spectrum of phenotypes beyond lethality, including drug-induced changes in stemness of PDOs. As part of the EIC Open Transition project, we will validate our next-generation platform for identifying therapeutics to target stem cell signaling pathways in CRC. Based on results by us showing that an interaction of MEK and Wnt signaling shifts the balance between stemness and differentiated cells, we will target Wnt pathways as a demonstrator for the technology. The ACHILLEUS project targets critical vulnerabilities in cancer and is based on technologies and approaches developed during previous ERC Advanced and ERC Proof-of-Concept grant-funded projects.

At the same time, effective methods to treat polyps in the colon are limited. Current approaches are often associated with unsafe oncological margins and high complication rates, requiring life-changing surgery.\nEndoTheranostics will usher in a new era for screening colonoscopy, advancing the frontiers of medical imaging and robotics. A tip-growing or eversion robot with a sleeve-like structure will be created to extend deep into hollow spaces while perceiving the environment through multimodal imaging and sensing. It will also act as a conduit to transfer miniaturised instruments to the remote site within the colon for diagnosis and therapy (theranostics). With these capabilities, the system will be able to offer:\n1. painless colon cleansing in preparation for endoscopy;\n2. real-time polyp detection and tissue characterisation through AI-assisted multimodal imaging;\n3. effective removal of polyps by conveying a \"miniature mobile operating chamber\" equipped with microsurgical tools to the target through the lumen of the eversion robot.\nThe unique technical and clinical challenges will be tackled by the PIs, each bringing complementary skills, backed by their institutions with wide expertise and exceptional facilities. The synergy and added value evident in this team will lead to breakthroughs not possible through independent research. The outcomes of EndoTheranostics will revolutionise the theranostics of CRC, impacting the quality of life of millions of individuals.

One key component is the synapse, which plays a crucial role in enabling the communication between neurons and serving as a dynamic, plastic memory where the strength of connections between neurons is stored. This characteristic allows for tuning these connections in a non-volatile and reversible manner, forming the foundation for intricate learning and memory processes.\n\nFor this purpose, the field of spintronics will be employed, focusing on controlling electron spin. Spintronics has gained significant importance in data storage applications, and spintronics nanodevices such as MTJs have recently emerged as promising candidates for neuromorphic computing due to their robustness, multifunctionalities and compatibility with compatibility to metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology. They hold strong appeal for the development of artificial synapses and neurons that mimic their biological counterparts due to their low power consumption and fast switching compared to traditional transistors.

The expected outcomes include increased value addition, competitiveness, sustainability, and resilience of European forest-based value chains, particularly in regions already or forecast to be impacted by climate change over the coming decades. OptiForValue will accelerate this transition by enhancing the sustainability, resilience, and profitability of regional value chains in Central European, Mediterranean and boreal, via case studies in Austria, Spain, Sweden, Finland. Significant long-term impacts are expected to be achieved, including a 10% reduction in wood damage, with a subsequent increase in wood harvesting (\u20ac240 M annually), 3% value addition from better quality control (\u20ac350 M annually), 5% increase in the forestry workforce in areas affected by climate change, and 5\u201310% reduction in fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.

Adoption of AI-based support systems in such applications is however minimal, chiefly due to the difficulty of assessing their assumptions, limitations and intentions.

TANGO will develop the theoretical basis and computational framework for hybrid decision support systems (HDSS) in which humans and machines are aligned in terms of values and goals, know their respective strengths, and work together to reach an optimal decision. To this end, TANGO will develop: 1) A cognitive theory of mutual understanding and hybrid decision making, of intuitive vs deliberative approaches to decision making and of how they affect our trust in human and AI teammates. 2) Cognition-aware explainable AIs implementing synergistic human-machine interaction, enabling machines to determine what information a specific decision maker (e.g., layperson vs expert) needs, or does not need, to reach an informed decision. 3) A \"Human-in-the-loop\" co-evolution of human decision making and machine learning models building on bi-directional, explanation-augmented interlocution. The TANGO framework will be evaluated on four high impact use cases, namely supporting: i) women during pregnancy and postpartum, ii) surgical teams in intraoperative decision making, iii) loan officers and applicants in credit lending decision processes, and iv) public policy makers in designing incentives and allocating funds.

The broad goal of this project is to tackle the generalization mystery in the context of both statistical learning and reinforcement learning, focusing on optimization algorithms being the de facto contemporary standard in training learning models.  Our methodology points out to inherent shortcomings of widely accepted viewpoints with regard to generalization of optimization-based learning algorithms, and takes a crucially different approach that targets the optimization algorithm itself; building bottom-up from fundamental and tractable optimization models, we identify intrinsic properties and develop algorithmic methodologies that enable optimization to effectively generalize in modern statistical- and reinforcement-learning scenarios.

        "justification": "Upon evaluating the two projects, AI4LIFE and OPTGEN, it is clear that there are both similarities and distinct differences that should be considered before deciding whether to merge them. Here's a breakdown based on each criterion:\n\n1. Minor objectives or methods: Both projects are rooted in machine learning and its applications, but they target different problem areas. AI4LIFE focuses on democratizing AI/ML for image data analysis in life sciences, while OPTGEN delves into understanding generalization in ML, particularly in optimization algorithms. Hence, they share some minor objectives but differ significantly in most areas. (1 point)\n\n2. Overlapping goals, methodologies, or innovations: There is some overlap in their goals and methodologies, such as the development of algorithms and models for machine learning. However, AI4LIFE's application domain is more specific to life sciences, whereas OPTGEN's focus is on a broader understanding of ML generalization principles that could apply to multiple domains. (1 point)\n\n3. Key similarities in scope, methodology, and innovation: Both projects emphasize the importance of enhancing ML models for practical applications. AI4LIFE aims to create a repository of pre-trained models for life scientists, while OPTGEN focuses on optimization techniques that improve generalization in ML. Though they could potentially benefit from shared insights in optimization and model generalization, their primary scopes still retain distinctions that justify their independence. (1 point)\n\n4. Close alignment in scope, methodology, and innovation for resource efficiency: Merging the projects might enhance resource use in the methodological development of ML models and their generalization principles. However, AI4LIFE's domain-specific focus on life sciences and community services contrasts with OPTGEN's theoretical and algorithmic focus on generalization across domains. Thus, they are not closely aligned enough to significantly benefit from merging. (0 points)\n\n5. Near identical in scope, methodology, and innovation: The projects are not nearly identical in scope or methodology. AI4LIFE is application-driven with a community aspect, whereas OPTGEN is research-driven with a focus on theoretical advancements.

ULTIMATE will pioneer the development of industrial-grade hybrid AI based on three stages to ensure trustworthiness, relying on interdisciplinary data sources and adhering to physical constraints (1st stage), as well as the development of tools for explaining, evaluating and validating hybrid AI algorithms and asserting their adherence to ethical and legal regulations (2nd stage). These will be exemplified using real-world industrial use cases (3rd stage) in the Robotics (collaboration between human and robots for logistics activities) and Space domains (Failure detection for satellites) to promote the widespread adoption of hybrid AI in industry.\nThe breakthrough generic hybrid AI architectures with improved explainability and interpretability and the predictive model on trustworthiness developed in ULTIMATE will provide industrials with improved shopfloor efficiency (reduction of downtime by 30% and of operational costs) and empower their staff through trustful human/machine cooperation allowing highly skilled jobs and increasing decision power and safety. This will be beneficial to European industry to gain pre-emptive advantage in the market of industrial AI solutions and will eventually increase trustworthiness in the use of hybrid AI components by the wider public.\nExtending over 36 months, the ULTIMATE project brings together key industrial stakeholders, with relevant end-users from manufacturing sectors, leading academic and research institutions, and SMEs to collaboratively investigate and lead the development of hybrid AI approaches.",

While AI-enabled digital health services and products are rapidly expanding in volume and variety, most of the AI innovations remain in the form of proof-of-concept. There is a continuous debate regarding whether AI is worthy of trust. The EU AI HLEG has defined that trustworthy AI systems should be lawful, ethical and robust. To translate it into actionable practices, provision of explainability, fairness and privacy is crucial. A considerable volume of research has been conducted in the areas of explainable AI, fair AI and privacy-preserving AI. However, the current research efforts to tackle the three challenges are fragmented and have culminated in a variety of solutions with heterogeneous, non-interoperable, or even conflicting capabilities.  The ambitious vision of HarmonicAI is to build a human-machine collaborative multi-objective design framework to foster coherently explainable, fair and privacy-preserving AI for digital health. HarmonicAI draws together proven experts in AI, health care, IoT, data science, privacy, cyber security, software engineering, HCI and industrial design with an underlying common aim to develop concrete technical and operational guidelines for AI practitioners to design human-centered, domain-specific, requirement-oriented trustworthy AI solutions, accelerating the scalable deployment of AI-powered digital health services and offering assurance to the public that AI in digital health is being developed and used in an ethical and trustworthy manner.",

AI has been rapidly growing in various industries, from financial services to healthcare, education, and job recruitment. However, as AI algorithms have become increasingly sophisticated and pervasive in decision-making processes, concerns have arisen about their fairness and compliance with regulations. In particular, the EU AI Act requires that AI providers in high-risk applications -- such as employment, credit, or healthcare -- to identify (and thereby address) discrimination by their algorithms against certain demographics of people. However, ensuring compliance with the Act can be challenging, particularly for AI startups that may not have the resources or expertise to fully understand and implement the Act's requirements. Addressing existing disconnects between AI fairness toolkits' capabilities and current practitioner needs, the Act.AI tool can be easily integrated into any AI workflow, in a plug and play fashion, to continuously monitor and improve its fairness. A key aspect of Act.AI is the ability to operate with different types of data (tabular, images, and text) in a variety of contexts (binary and multiclass classification and regression). It is also able to match datasets in different domains including out-of-distribution data even if these datasets have different numbers of variables or features.

In the criminal procedural field, AI is enhancing the efficiency of law enforcement authorities and criminal justice systems in both preventing and prosecuting crimes, through the streamlining of tasks like data analysis, evidence assessment, and crime prediction. Despite this accelerating trend, a conspicuous gap persists due to the lack of a clear and comprehensive legal framework at both national and supranational levels. An additional factor hindering a responsible and beneficial implementation of AI in the criminal procedural sector is that some technical characteristics of the AI prototypes developed so far (e.g. opacity) interfere with some criminal procedural principles and standards. The lack of dialogue between legal scholarship and scientific community prevents the identification of suitable technical solutions. Given this scenario, managing the legal and ethical implications of AI in the criminal justice system proves to be a prohibitive challenge. The aim of FUTURE is twofold: to support national legislators across the EU in the regulation of artificial intelligence in criminal procedure, while fostering a harmonized approach to the subject; to bridge the gap between the technical and the legal community, ensuring the compliance of AI systems implemented in the criminal procedural field with its principles and safeguards.

This dramatic clinical evidence requires immediate action in terms of early diagnosis and then pre-emptive therapies, not only for the primary tumor, but especially at the first stages of metastasis formation. Metastasis is the result of a complex mechanism, still under study, which involves the trafficking of biological materials, in particular extracellular vesicles (EVs), from the primary tumor site towards other tissues.\nThe project AI CUrES aims to propose novel methodologies for early diagnosis of metastasis, by gaining new knowledge at the early stage of their formation with a real-time and predictive approach. This work has the future vision of predicting possible patient\u2019s outcomes and helping to set timely pre-emptive therapies. I believe that this is possible by exploiting the EVs specifically produced by the primary tumor, here by colorectal cancer (CRC). In AI CUrES, such EVs will be tagged by specific nanosized-contrast agents and their trafficking in biological media reported by an innovative multi-modal bioimaging technology having high resolution, deep tissue penetration, real-time and molecular characteristics. The collected images of EVs trafficking towards recipient cells or tissues will be refined and further elaborated by artificial intelligence algorithms, with the aim to predict the possible metastasis development from a starting CRC tumor mass.\nAI CuRES will prove the efficacy of this approach by enabling, as expected outcomes, deep scientific knowledge on metastasis formation mechanisms and demonstrating a breakthrough innovation in bioimaging technologies and digital tools for health monitoring and diagnosis of oncological patients. The results can be also useful in other tumors leading to metastasis and to empower Europe towards digital tools for predictive diagnosis.",

However, the mechanisms governing the onset of metastasis are far from being fully understood. Notably, metastases are predominantly clonal and arise from a single cell. 3DSecret will investigate metastasis from a radically new perspective, with the overarching goal of unravelling stochastic patterns at the single-cell level with predictive and prognostic capacity. Critically, defining the hallmarks of metastasis from holistic studies of single circulating tumour cells (CTCs), thus dissecting tumour heterogeneity, has the power to revolutionise cancer treatment and diagnosis. This will pave the way for game-changing discoveries in what is one of the holy grails of modern clinical science. To achieve our goal, 3DSecret will use a set of key enabling technologies including microfluidics, nanosensors, genomics, and artificial intelligence (AI). Microfluidics will drive the isolation of single CTCs from whole blood samples of 60+ metastatic breast cancer patients. These will be grown on-chip to form 3D spheroids, thus allowing comprehensive genomic and transcriptomic studies of single-cell origin while bypassing the errors typically introduced by single-cell genome amplification. The genomic and transcriptomic data will be combined with clinical information, single-cell growth profiles and dynamic metabolomic analyses obtained by the use of nanosensors and SERS, to develop a multimodal AI analytical tool capable of identifying unknown patterns driving metastasis. The bold assumption that there could be stochastic patterns driving metastasis, cancer evolution and malignancy, makes the approach of 3DSecret exceptionally high-risk, high-gain. We are confident that such a breakthrough would lead to a major paradigm shift with significant implications in biology, physics, disruptive technologies such as AI, and critically, in the medical arena and patient care.",

Learning algorithms are applied in an ever-increasing variety of contexts, ranging from engineering challenges such as self-driving cars all the way to societal contexts involving private data. These developments pose important challenges (i) Many of the recent breakthroughs demonstrate phenomena that lack explanations, and sometimes even contradict conventional wisdom. One main reason for this is because classical ML theory adopts a worst-case perspective which is too pessimistic to explain practical ML: in reality data is rarely worst-case, and experiments indicate that often much less data is needed than predicted by traditional theory. (ii) The increase in ML applications that involve private and sensitive data highlights the need for algorithms that handle the data responsibly. While this need has been addressed by the field of Differential Privacy (DP), the cost of privacy remains poorly understood: How much more data does private learning require, compared to learning without privacy constraints? Inspired by these challenges, our guiding question is:  How much data is needed for learning? Towards answering this question we aim to develop a theory of generalization which complements the traditional theory and is better fit to model real-world learning tasks. We will base it on distribution-, data-, and algorithm-dependent perspectives. These complement the  distribution-free worst-case perspective of the classical theory, and are suitable for exploiting specific properties of a given learning task. We will use this theory to study various settings, including supervised, semisupervised, interactive, and private learning. We believe that this research will advance the field in terms of efficiency, reliability, and applicability. Furthermore, our work combines ideas from various areas in computer science and mathematics; we thus expect further impact outside our field.",

Learning algorithms are typically classified into either deep learning or classic learning, where deep learning excels when data and computing resources are abundant, whereas classic algorithms shine when data is scarce. In the TUCLA project, we expand our theoretical understanding of classic machine learning, with a particular emphasis on two of the most important such algorithms, namely Bagging and Boosting. As a result of this study, we shall provide faster learning algorithms that require less training data to make accurate predictions. The project accomplishes this by pursuing several objectives:\n\n1. We will establish a novel learning theoretic framework for proving generalization bounds for learning algorithms. Using the framework, we will design new Boosting algorithms and prove that they make accurate predictions using less training data than what was previously possible. Moreover, we complement these algorithms by generalization lower bounds, proving that no other algorithm can make better use of data.\n            \n2. We will design parallel versions of Boosting algorithms, thereby allowing them to be used in combination with more computationally expensive base learning algorithms. We conjecture that success in this direction may lead to Boosting playing a more central role also in deep learning.\n\n3. We will explore applications of the classic Bagging heuristic. Until recently, Bagging was not known to have significant theoretical benefits. However, recent pioneering work by the PI shows that Bagging is an optimal learning algorithm in an important learning setup. Using these recent insights, we will explore theoretical applications of Bagging in other important settings.",

Ultrafine particles (< 10 nm) show adverse effects on our public health, as inhalation leads to an elevated risk of lung- and cardiovascular diseases. Aerosol particles also influence the global climate, by scattering sunlight away from Earth's surface and acting as seeds for cloud droplet formation. Combined, these effects lead to an overall cooling of the Earth, directly counteracting the warming effect of greenhouse gases. According to the IPCC, aerosol particles pose the largest uncertainty in global climate forecast. This uncertainty is caused by the lack of understanding of the early growth behaviour of small (< 3 nm) particles. The largest source of aerosol particles (50-90%) is from nucleation of vapours in the air leading to a burst of freshly nucleated particles (FNPs) of 1-2 nm in size. However, even the basic fundamental properties of these FNPs remain unknown and cannot be studied using currently available experimental techniques. I propose a unique approach to target the properties of FNPs by applying a versatile suite of computational methods, ranging from quantum chemical calculations to application of conceptually new machine learning models. The scientific objectives are: 1) To determine the chemical composition and stability of FNPs. 2) To understand how FNPs evolve over time via exchange of vapours with the environment. 3) To investigate how FNPs transform as a consequence of chemical reactions occurring at the surface or inside the particles. The research will provide unprecedented insight into the molecular level properties of FNPs. This project will directly supply input parameters (chemical composition, thermodynamics and kinetics) for atmospheric models, which are crucial in order to constrain the large uncertainty in climate predictions caused by small aerosol particles.",

However, uncertainties in the magnitude of the net cooling impact of aerosols on climate and in the cloud response to evolving anthropogenic emissions and climate change induced feedbacks on natural emissions are major challenges that limit our understanding of how global and regional climate, including extremes, respond to changes in greenhouse gases. It is of paramount importance to better understand aerosol-cloud processes and their role in the Earth System, from regional to global scales, and over different time scales, from days to decades. Over the last decade, extensive research networks, infrastructures, satellite instruments, and atmospheric models have been developed, making it possible to obtain a holistic view of the effects of clouds and aerosols on climate and weather. CERTAINTY will capitalise on this available data together with advanced algorithms, machine learning and data assimilation methods, high resolution models, and Earth system models to bring the fundamental knowledge of interactions between clouds, aerosols, and radiation to a new level. The consortium partners are in key roles as operators, data originators, developers, providers, and users of European aerosol and cloud data and ESMs/high resolution models. The consortium leads the activities of next generation satellite missions (such as EarthCARE), and the development of new satellite products, to facilitate their scientific use in CERTAINTY by preparing tools for early adoption of data. CERTAINTY will bring the observation-based knowledge to be used in modeling frameworks to improve predictive models and knowledge of processes controlling aerosols, clouds, and their interactions from hours to decades. The ultimate outcome will be better understanding and predictions of extreme events that facilitates planning of climate mitigation/adaptation strategies for the good of European citizens and global society.",

            "objective": "The silent pandemic of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing global health crisis with a projected annual mortality rate of 10 million by 2050. Addressing this crisis critically depends on fast, accessible and precise diagnostics to improve detection and prevention of infection and guide antibiotic therapy. Current diagnostics often have insufficient turnaround time or data for timely detection and prevention of outbreaks or precision antibiotic therapy guidance, and accessibility is often limited due to the required infrastructure and expert personnel. To overcome these shortcomings, and address AMR, we are developing a diagnostic based on accelerated whole genome sequencing linked with AI-assisted data analysis. This project termed \"DRAIGON\" includes a consortium of internationally recognized experts in sequencing platform and assay development, bioinformatics and machine learning, clinical microbiology, infection prevention and control, antibiotic therapy and stewardship, and health economics to jointly develop our in vitro diagnostic solution to target virtually any pathogen-antibiotic combination. We propose to validate and demonstrate the clinical utility of DRAIGON focusing on bloodstream and prosthetic joint infections at five independent sites, including one located in a medium income country representative of areas with a high AMR burden and reduced access to laboratory infrastructure. The diagnostic will be easy to implement and functions as an early detection system to prevent the cross-border spread of pathogens. In rapidly and accurately providing pathogen ID and type, a comprehensive antibiogram, and outbreak cluster information directly from genome data and in a single assay, this innovative high-resolution diagnostic aims to reinforce the global fight against AMR infections and enable the antibiotic stewardship goals of \"right antibiotic, at the right dose, for the right patient, and at the right time\".",

            "objective": "Abuse and overuse of antibiotics has led to antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which is a major global health concern. In the EU, there are around 30,000 AMR-related deaths per year, and the incidence of AMR is on the rise; experts have predicted a loss of 10 million lives by 2050. One of the reasons to find alternatives to tackle this grave and complicated health challenge is that only very few antibiotics are discovered and those in the pipeline do not have the ability to circumvent AMR development in microbes. Thus, there is a need for discovery of novel antimicrobial agents that can take the place of conventional antibiotics. In comparison to conventional antibiotics, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) especially bacteriocins, are effective in rapidly eradicating microbes, thereby reducing AMR-related issues. Hence, the proposed project aims to identify ideal AMPs that can eradicate pathogens and reduce the emergence of AMR. The approach will be to mine the sequences of the most dominant commensal genomes to identify suitable candidate AMPs. The identified AMPs will be stored in an online catalogue which can be leveraged by researchers working in the same field. Furthermore, the anti-pathogenic ability of the selected AMPs will be confirmed through in-vitro techniques followed by studying their AMR developing propensity. Additionally, genes leading to AMR will be identified and knocked out to study the effect on AMR. Furthermore, the synergistic activity of the identified AMPs along with antibiotics will also be studied. These objectives will be achieved by using advanced computational and machine learning techniques followed by in-vitro techniques. The project will lead to discovery of AMPs with least AMR developing propensity and will also provide information about putative AMPs that can be developed   along with Toscana Life Sciences (TLS) Foundation (industrial placement) to explore their therapeutic potential.",

In addition, trustworthiness is not assessed throughout the lifecycle of AI system development so developers often fail to grasp a holistic view across different AI risks. Last, the lack of a unified, multi-disciplinary AI, Data and Robotics ecosystem for assessing trustworthiness across several critical AI application domains hampers the definition and implementation of a robust AI paradigm shift framework towards increased trustworthiness and accelerated AI adoption. \nTo address this critical unmet needs, FAITH innovation action will develop and validate a human-centric, trustworthiness optimization ecosystem, which enables measuring, optimizing and counteracting the risks associated with AI adoption and trustworthiness in critical domains, namely robotics, education, media, transport, healthcare, active ageing, and industrial processes through seven international Large Scale Pilots. Notably, cross-fertilization actions will create a joint outcome, which will bring together the visions and specificities of all the pilots.

Both adopt human-centric approaches and involve multidisciplinary teams and practical large-scale applications. Nevertheless, HarmonicAI specifies a more detailed methodology focusing on multi-objective design in the health sector, whereas FAITH emphasizes cross-cutting risk management across various critical domains. There are distinct elements, so they satisfy some overlapping goals but warrant separate pursuits. (2 points)\n\n3.

Personalised medicine, comprising tailored approaches for prevention, diagnosis, monitoring and treatment is essential to reduce the burden of disease and improve the quality of life. Integration of multiple data types (multimodal data) into artificial intelligence models is required for the development of accurate and personalised interventions. This is particularly true for the inclusion of genomic data, which is information-rich and individual-specific, and more routinely available as the cost of sequencing continues to fall. Multimodal data integration is complex due to privacy & governance requirements, the presence of multiple standards, distinct data formats, and underlying data complexity and volume. NextGen tools will remove barriers in data integration several cardiovascular use cases. NextGen deliverables will include tooling for multimodal data integration and research portability, extension of secure federated analytics to genomic computation, more effective federated learning over distributed infrastructures, more effective and accessible tools for genomic data analysis; improved clinical efficiency of variant prioritisation; scalable genomic data curation; and improved data discoverability and data management. A comprehensive gap analysis of the existing landscape, factoring ongoing initiatives will ensure NextGen deliverables are forward-looking and complementary. NextGen embedded governance framework and robust regulatory processes will ensure secure multi-jurisdictional multiomic multimodal data access aligned with initiatives including \"1+ Million Genomes\" and the European Health Data Space. Several real-world pilots will demonstrate the effectiveness of NextGen tools and will be integrated in the NextGen Pathfinder network of five collaborating clinical sites as a self-contained data ecosystem and comprehensive proof of concept.",

Nevertheless, the reuse of patient data is often limited to datasets available at a single medical centre. The main reasons why health data is not shared across institutional borders rely on ethical, legal, and privacy aspects and rules.\nTherefore, in order to (1) enable health data sharing across national borders, (2) fully comply with present GDPR privacy guidelines / regulations and (3) innovate by pushing research beyond the state of the art, BETTER proposes a robust decentralised privacy-preserving infrastructure which will empower researchers, innovators and healthcare professionals to exploit the full potential of larger sets of multi-source health data via tailored made AI tools useful to compare, integrate, and analyse in a secure, cost-effective fashion; with the very final aim of supporting the improvement of citizen\u2019s health outcomes.\nIn detail, this interdisciplinary project proposes the co-creation of 3 clinical use cases involving 7 medical centres located in the EU and beyond, where sensitive patient data, including genomics, are made available and analysed in a GDPR-compliant mechanism via a Distributed Analytics (DA) paradigm called the Personal Health Train (PHT). The main principle of the PHT is that the analytical task is brought to the data provider (medical centre) and the data instances remain in their original location.\nIn this project, two mature implementations of the PHT (PADME and Vantage6) already validated in real-world scenarios will be fused together to build the BETTER platform.",

            "objective": "Despite the impressive advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), current robotic solutions fall short of the expectations when they are requested to operate in partially unknown environments. Most of all, robots lack the cognitive capabilities to understand a task to the point of being able to perform it in a different domain. As humans, during the learning process we gain deep insights on the execution of a process, which allows us to replicate its execution in a different domain with a little effort. We are also able to invert the task execution and to react to contingencies, by focusing the attention to the most critical prediction phases. However, replicating these cognitive processes in AI-driven robots is challenging as it needs a profound rethinking of the robot learning paradigm itself. The robot needs to understand how to act and imagine, like humans do, the possible consequences of its actions in another domain. This demands for a novel framework that embraces different levels of abstraction, starting from physical interaction with the environment, passing through active perception and understanding, and ending-up with decision-making. The INVERSE project aims to provide robots with these essential cognitive abilities by adopting a continual learning approach. After an initial bootstrap phase, used to create initial knowledge from human-level specifications, the robot refines its repertoire by capitalising on its own experience and on human feedback. This experience-driven strategy permits to frame different problems, like performing a task in a different domain, as a problem of fault detection and recovery. Humans have a central role in INVERSE, since their supervision helps limit the complexity of the refinement loop, making the solution suitable for deployment in production scenarios. The effectiveness of developed solutions will be demonstrated in two complementary use cases designed to be a realistic instantiation of the actual work environments.",

            "objective": "\"Deep Learning (DL) has reached unparalleled performance in many domains. However, this impressive performance typically comes at the cost of gathering large datasets and training massive models, requiring extended time and prohibitive costs. Significant research efforts are being invested in improving DL training efficiency, i.e., the amount of time, data, and resources required to train these models, by changing the model (e.g., architecture, numerical precision) or the training algorithm (e.g., parallelization). Other modifications aim to address critical issues, such as credibility and over-confidence, which hinder the implementation of DL in the real world. However, such modifications often cause an unexplained degradation in the generalization performance of DL to unseen data. Recent findings suggest that this degradation is caused by changes to the hidden algorithmic bias of the training algorithm and model. This bias selects a specific solution from all solutions which fit the data. After years of trial-and-error, this bias in DL is often at a \"sweet spot\" which implicitly allows ANNs to learn well, due to unknown key design choices. But performance typically degrades when these choices change. Therefore, understanding and controlling algorithmic bias is the key to unlocking the true potential of deep learning.\n\nOur goal is to develop a rigorous theory of algorithmic bias in DL and to apply it to alleviate critical practical bottlenecks that prevent such models from scaling up or implemented in real-world applications.\n\nOur approach has three objectives: (1) identify the algorithmic biases affecting DL; (2) understand how these biases affect the functional capabilities and generalization performance; and (3) control these biases to alleviate critical practical bottlenecks. To demonstrate the feasibility of this challenging project, we describe how recent advances and concrete preliminary results enable us to effectively approach all these objectives.\"",

            "objective": "Deep learning (DL) has recently achieved remarkable success due to the continuous growth in model sizes. However, this growth has led to increased energy consumption. Hardware implementation of digital DL can help reduce energy usage, but the Von Neumann architecture of current DL has hindered its practical realization. In contrast, the brain exhibits energy-efficient multiscale spatiotemporal processing. Biologically plausible (BiP) frameworks have emerged as alternatives to mainstream DL. These methods use bottom-up and top-down signals, incorporating feedforward and feedback mechanisms, and local objectives instead of global error. Recently, I demonstrated that a BiP opto-analog hardware can achieve competitive performance compared to digital DL for feedforward networks. However, transformers, the backbone of current DL, are challenging to implement due to the input-dependent quadratic complexity in the transformer's attention. This project leverages the multiscale dynamics in the primary vision system to explore BiP architectures for transformers.\n\nThe project is hosted at the University of T\u00fcbingen under Matthias Bethge and Thomas Euler, who have a long-standing effort in the system identification of mouse retina via DL. The project has three objectives. First, I will extract top-down information from neural recordings of ganglion cells in the mouse retina, focusing on unique spatiotemporal features that maximally activate specific cell types. Next, I will combine top-down signals with bottom-up models of the retina using recurrent architectures with linear complexity and compare their performance in classification tasks to a vision transformer for the retina. Lastly, I propose a BiP transformer with local weight updates. I will examine the robustness of models under data distribution shifts and noise injection. A positive outcome of the project will address energy and cost issues of AI and help me progress my academic career in this interdisciplinary field.",

This has led to the development of Common European data spaces, yet the governance of the data life cycle in organizations has not kept up with the rapid technology evolution and remains largely manual. This is especially evident in scenarios where tens or hundreds of continuously evolving data sources produce semi-structured data, and create significant challenges when governed manually, causing organizations to end up with data silos.

Diagnostic and therapeutic effectiveness depends on multimodal information, including cancer type, stage, and location as well as the patient\u2019s age and health. Current clinical methods do not effectively use the large amount of mostly unstructured data. The main challenge in developing multimodal models is the lack of access to data sources and missing joint validation of data through collaboration between clinicians and computer scientists. A strength of our consortium is access to multiple sources of medical data, including the largest expert-annotated database for PCa and KC to date. Our overall goal is to develop and deploy marketable data-driven multimodal decision support systems to improve clinical prognosis, patient stratification and individual therapy for patients suffering from PCa or KC, defining a new state-of-the-art for the development of multimodal medical AI applications. We will develop AI models for PCa and KC that incorporate multimodal data, e.g., image data, unstructured medical text notes, laboratory information and biomarkers, and perform a prospective validation of the models in a large prospective multicentric international study. At the same time, we will assess the trust of healthcare professionals and patients in such AI tools and explore how this trust can be increased.\n\nBy providing improved, personalised diagnosis and prognosis assessment, the multimodal models will ultimately contribute to better patient outcomes and quality of life. The models developed in this study can be used as basis for any use case where imaging and electronic medical records are relevant, as they are easily adaptable and can help combat different types of cancer.",

Evidently, clinical management of PCa is not optimal, as patients which do not require treatment are over-treated, while for those that immediate actions are required, efficient treatment are still needed. \nTo fill the above gaps, PROMOTE was formed to educate DCs in emerging -omics and AI technologies and deliver:\na) novel non-invasive tools (based on biomarker- and AI- models) to guide intervention, and\nb) more efficient treatment options for advanced PCa (particularly metastatic) driven by molecular characterisation of the disease phenotypes.\nPROMOTE brings together 13 leading centers from different disciplines, including 3 SMEs, 4 university hospitals with clinical laboratories and 2 research institutes and 4 universities, closely collaborating with solid scientific background, as demonstrated by multiple publications. PROMOTE research builds on:\ni) available biobanks and -omics datasets within PROMOTE consortium, including >3000 urinary proteomics, >1100 imaging datasets paired with biopsy and pathology data, >350 paired RNA and proteomics urinary profiles, >100 tissue proteomics and ~300 phospho, proteo-genomic and transcriptomics profiles from public repositories,\nii) established software and analytical protocols on -omics data integration, AI feature extraction and integration, systems biology, pathway enrichment, drug repurposing and in vitro testing, and\niii) infrastructure to support hosting and training of DCs.\nMoreover, PROMOTE training programme has strong innovation and industrial focus.",

They both focus on integrating AI and multimodal data (e.g., imaging, text, biomarkers) to improve clinical management of urologic cancers, particularly prostate cancer. They also share overlapping goals of enhancing diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment personalized to the patient's condition. Their methodologies involve the use of large-scale, annotated datasets and advanced AI models for predicting outcomes and stratifying patients. However, there are distinct elements between the two, which might argue for proceeding independently. While COMFORT focuses broadly on PCa and KC, with an emphasis on trust-building among healthcare professionals and patients regarding AI tools, PROMOTE is more specific to prostate cancer and has a notable educational component aimed at training doctoral candidates in emerging -omics and AI technologies.

Furthermore, personalized approaches for screening are needed, to consider genetic and other socioeconomic variables and environmental stressors that lead to different onsets of the disease. ONCOSCREEN responds to these challenges by developing a risk-based, population-level stratification methodology for CRC, to account for genetic prevalence, socio-economic status, and other factors. It complements this methodology by a) developing a set of novel, practical, and low-cost screening technologies with high sensitivity and specificity, b) leveraging AI to improve existing methodologies for CRC screening, allowing for the early detection of polyps and provision of a personalized risk status stratification, and c) providing a mobile app for self-monitoring and CRC awareness raising. Furthermore, ONCOSCREEN develops an Intelligent Analytics dashboard for policy makers facilitating effective policy making at regional and national levels. Through a multi-level campaign, the above-mentioned solutions are tested and validated. For the clinical solutions specifically, a clinical validation study has been planned with the participation of 4100 enrolled patients/citizens. To ensure the adoption of the developed solutions by the healthcare systems, their cost-effectiveness and financial viability will be assessed. The 48-months duration project will be implemented by a multidisciplinary consortium comprising of 38 partners, including technical solutions providers, hospitals, Ministries of Health as policy makers, legal and ethics experts, Insurance companies, involving actively end-users/citizens in all phases of implementation through targeted workshops.

In Europe alone, more than 340,000 people are diagnosed with colorectal cancer each year. While treatment options of CRC have expanded over the last decades, the survival rates of patients suffering from advanced-stage cancers remain poor. Stemness of neoplastic cells has been proposed as a major factor in treatment resistance and high relapse rates, however, drugs targeting stem cell signaling pathways in cancer are still lacking today. We propose developing and validating a new drug discovery platform based on patient-derived organoids (PDOs) and machine learning-assisted phenotypic target validation and drug discovery. Using this platform, we have previously shown that we can identify a broad spectrum of phenotypes beyond lethality, including drug-induced changes in stemness of PDOs. As part of the EIC Open Transition project, we will validate our next-generation platform for identifying therapeutics to target stem cell signaling pathways in CRC. Based on results by us showing that an interaction of MEK and Wnt signaling shifts the balance between stemness and differentiated cells, we will target Wnt pathways as a demonstrator for the technology. The ACHILLEUS project targets critical vulnerabilities in cancer and is based on technologies and approaches developed during previous ERC Advanced and ERC Proof-of-Concept grant-funded projects. The project?s ultimate aim is to spin out a NewCo as a phenotypic drug discovery platform for targeting cancer stem cell pathways.",

Learning algorithms are applied in an ever-increasing variety of contexts, ranging from engineering challenges such as self-driving cars all the way to societal contexts involving private data. These developments pose important challenges (i) Many of the recent breakthroughs demonstrate phenomena that lack explanations, and sometimes even contradict conventional wisdom. One main reason for this is because classical ML theory adopts a worst-case perspective which is too pessimistic to explain practical ML: in reality data is rarely worst-case, and experiments indicate that often much less data is needed than predicted by traditional theory. (ii) The increase in ML applications that involve private and sensitive data highlights the need for algorithms that handle the data responsibly. While this need has been addressed by the field of Differential Privacy (DP), the cost of privacy remains poorly understood: How much more data does private learning require, compared to learning without privacy constraints? Inspired by these challenges, our guiding question is:  How much data is needed for learning? Towards answering this question we aim to develop a theory of generalization which complements the traditional theory and is better fit to model real-world learning tasks. We will base it on distribution-, data-, and algorithm-dependent perspectives. These complement the  distribution-free worst-case perspective of the classical theory, and are suitable for exploiting specific properties of a given learning task. We will use this theory to study various settings, including supervised, semisupervised, interactive, and private learning. We believe that this research will advance the field in terms of efficiency, reliability, and applicability. Furthermore, our work combines ideas from various areas in computer science and mathematics; we thus expect further impact outside our field.",

They have proven to be very effective in solving prediction tasks in computer vision, natural language processing, and computational biology, for example, but they mostly remain black boxes that are hard to interpret, computationally demanding, and not robust to small data perturbations.\nWith a strong emphasis on visual modeling, the grand challenge of APHELEIA is to develop a new generation of machine learning models that are more robust, interpretable, and efficient, and do not require massive amounts of data to produce accurate predictions. To achieve this objective, we will foster new interactions between classical signal processing, statistics, optimization, and modern deep learning. Our goal is to reduce the need for massive data by enabling scientists and engineers to design trainable machine learning models that directly encode a priori knowledge of the task semantics and data formation process, while automatically prefering simple and stable solutions over complex ones. These models will be built on solid theoretical foundations with convergence and robustness guarantees, which are important to make real-life trustworthy predictions in the wild. We will implement these ideas in an open-source software toolbox readily applicable to visual recognition and inverse imaging problems, which will also handle other modalities.

They aim to tackle the challenges of current ML paradigms, although from slightly different vantage points - GENERALIZATION focusing on data requirements and APHELEIA on model interpretability and robustness.\n\n\nThird Criterion: Both projects share similarities in scope and methodology, bringing in novel innovations that challenge traditional approaches. However, GENERALIZATION primarily focuses on developing a theory of generalization while APHELEIA emphasizes practical applications and the development of an open-source toolbox. These distinctions suggest that while they can proceed independently, merging them might not offer significant benefits over individual implementation.\n\n\nFourth Criterion: The alignment in scope, methodology, and innovation is close, especially with both projects addressing real-world machine learning challenges. Combining them would likely improve resource efficiency and could enhance the overall research output, particularly since both projects draw from various areas of computer science and mathematics. Merging would result in a deeper integration of distributed-, data-, algorithm-dependent perspectives with practical applications aimed at robustness and interpretability.\n\n\nFifth Criterion: The projects are not nearly identical in their scope and specific methodologies, but they are close. While merging would optimize resources due to their strong commonalities, keeping them separate exhibits marginal inefficiencies.\n\n\nIn conclusion, merging these projects is likely beneficial, producing a comprehensive approach to rethinking modern machine learning through the lens of both theoretical improvements and practical applications.

Given the rapid development of these tools, the risk of negative implications is significant if LLMs are not developed and deployed in a way that is aligned with human values and responds to individual needs and preferences. To mitigate any negative consequences, academia, in close collaboration with industry, needs to train the next generation of researchers to understand the complexities of the socio-technical implications surrounding the use of LLMs.  \n\nThe alignAI Doctoral Network will train 17 doctoral candidates (DCs) to work in the international and highly interdisciplinary field of LLM research and development. The core of the project focuses on the alignment of LLMs with human values, identifying relevant values and methods for alignment implementation. Two principles provide a foundation for the approach. First, explainability is a key enabler for all aspects of trustworthiness, accelerating development, promoting usability, and facilitating human oversight and auditing of LLMs. Second, fairness is a key aspect of trustworthiness, facilitating access to AI applications and ensuring equal impact of AI-driven decision-making. The practical relevance of the project is ensured by three use cases in education, positive mental health, and news consumption. This approach allows us to develop specific guidelines and test prototypes and tools to promote value alignment.

Adoption of AI-based support systems in such applications is however minimal, chiefly due to the difficulty of assessing their assumptions, limitations and intentions. In order to realise the promise of AI for individuals, society and economy, people should feel they can trust AIs in terms of reliability, capacity to understand the human\u2019s needs, and guarantees that they are genuinely aiming at helping them. TANGO will develop the theoretical basis and computational framework for hybrid decision support systems (HDSS) in which humans and machines are aligned in terms of values and goals, know their respective strengths, and work together to reach an optimal decision. To this end, TANGO will develop: 1) A cognitive theory of mutual understanding and hybrid decision making, of intuitive vs deliberative approaches to decision making and of how they affect our trust in human and AI teammates. 2) Cognition-aware explainable AIs implementing synergistic human-machine interaction, enabling machines to determine what information a specific decision maker (e.g., layperson vs expert) needs, or does not need, to reach an informed decision. 3) A \"Human-in-the-loop\" co-evolution of human decision making and machine learning models building on bi-directional, explanation-augmented interlocution. The TANGO framework will be evaluated on four high impact use cases, namely supporting: i) women during pregnancy and postpartum, ii) surgical teams in intraoperative decision making, iii) loan officers and applicants in credit lending decision processes, and iv) public policy makers in designing incentives and allocating funds. Success in these case studies will establish TANGO as the framework of reference for developing a new generation of synergistic AI systems, and will strengthen the leadership of Europe in human-centric AI.",

In 6G, several key technical enablers are envisioned: i) mmWave and THz frequencies electromagnetic with extremely large bandwidths, and extremely large antenna arrays; ii) reconfigurable intelligent surfaces that control the propagation environment; and iii) machine learning to solve problems for which mathematical models are not sufficient. As location-aware communication (i.e., to optimize network efficiency and communication capacity by exploiting location, map, and trajectory information) is already a part of 5G, we expect that the 6G key enablers will also lead to high-accuracy sensing and localization and, in turn, improve communication quality. The goal of this project is to develop integrated sensing, localization, and communication systems for 6G, and the project comprises the following 3 work packages (WPs). In WP1, joint parameter estimation methods for the 6G channel are studied, and low-complexity methods will be developed based on the inherent high resolution of the 6G channel. By exploiting the estimated channel parameters of 6G signals, novel methods for estimating user state as well as sensing the time-varying propagation environment will be developed in WP2. We will design methods to use sensing and localization information from WP2 for initial beam search, beamspace processing, beam alignment, and power allocation in WP3.

            "objective": "As the technological world marches ahead, the advent of the sixth generation (6G) networks promises unprecedented advancements in communication capabilities. One of the core components of 6G systems will be the inclusion of various large array structures such as the extremely large antenna array, reconfigurable intelligent surface, and cell-free multiple-input multiple-output. Ttraditional positioning and tracking methodologies (which are based on far-field signal models) are ill-suited for these innovations. This is mainly caused by curved wavefront in the near-field models. Consequently, the conventional methods for positioning both passive objects (e.g., walls) and active users (e.g., phones) will be severely degraded when the far-field assumption does not hold. On the other hand, the radio signals optimized for positioning and sensing in the far-field are sub-optimal in the near-field regime. To address this gap, this research aims to develop novel positioning and tracking methods tailored explicitly for the near-field environment of these large array structures. To this end, three work packages (WP) are conducted. WP1 is to design optimal signal waveforms for positioning and sensing with large and/or sparse antenna arrays that can make full use of the near-field features. WP2 is to develop phase-coherent sensing and tracking methods for non-isotropic and extended targets. WP3 is to develop algorithms for carrier-phase based positioning and tracking of active targets, by using the near-field signals transmitted by them. This research intends to solve these challenges through the development and implementation of innovative algorithms and methodologies, such as compressive sensing, convex or non-convex optimization, and machine learning, establishing a dedicated framework for near-field positioning and tracking in 6G networks.",

Among various non-CO2 effects, the contrail-cirrus radiative forcing is the largest (~2/3) with large uncertainties. The most critical affecting factor is the huge weather-induced variability of the radiative impact of individual contrails. This is the quantity, BeCoM will predict better since the knowledge of the individual radiative forcing is the basis for avoidance of just those contrails that contribute most to the overall climate impact. Once this is standard, it will be possible to formulate adequate mitigation measures and develop policy-driven implementation schemes. \nBeCoM will address the uncertainties related to the forecasting of persistent contrails and their weather-dependent individual radiative effects. BeCoM focuses on: 1) obtaining a larger and higher resolution database of relative humidity and ice supersaturation at cruise levels for assimilation into numerical weather prediction (NWP) models; 2) providing more adequate representation of ice clouds in their supersaturated environment in the NWP models; and 3) validation of the predictions to determine and reduce the remaining uncertainties of contrail forecasts. To facilitate the assimilation and validation process, BeCoM will develop a novel hybrid artificial intelligence algorithm. Based on the contrail prediction, BeCoM will develop a policy framework for effective contrail avoidance through a trajectory optimization approach. BeCoM will enable a better understanding of contrail\u2019s climate impact and formulate recommendations on how to implement strategies to enable air traffic management to reduce aviation's climate impact.

            "objective": "In recent years, the use of machine learning (ML) for the study of physics has experienced a strong boost. However, most of the machines used are black boxes, and the causal relation between inputs and outputs is often impossible to extract. Nonetheless, a critical aspect when dealing with physical systems is not only to make correct predictions, but to understand the physical laws which underlie these assessments. Recently, an increasing number of works aim at developing interpretable ML methods, from which such hidden laws can be extracted. However, their application to physics has been often limited to supervised and unsupervised learning approaches.\nThe aim of this project is: 1) construct an interpretable reinforcement learning method; 2) extract hidden rules and features in timely and paramount problems in physics. The method combines three well-established concepts of ML: projective simulation, graph neural networks (GNN) and hidden variable disentanglement. PS provides interpretable RL agents that can be trained for a variety of tasks, from the construction of quantum experiments, via skill acquisition in robotics, to the modelling of honeybee colonies. By enhancing their learning power and interpretability with GNNs and variable disentanglement, we will extract the hidden features of the systems the RL agents have interacted with and ultimately, the physical laws governing them. In particular, we will tackle problems in the field of condensed matter, where particles diffuse either passively or actively, to reach a target state. Moreover, we will consider ensembles of RL agents, so as to analyze not only the physical properties of the systems, but also their interactions and communication dynamics in the quest of a common target.\nThe originality of the proposal is directly related to: 1) the methods that will be developed; 2) the systems of study; 3) most importantly, the information we will access and discover with the interpretable RL agents.",

However, implementing such algorithms in low-power devices remains a challenge due to the energy inefficiency that comes from separating logic and memory in current electronic systems. For the past 10 years, research groups have been developing alternative electronic components and systems, such as brain inspired computing architectures and novel resistive memory technologies to address this design bottleneck. The critical feature for these new technologies to perform at their best is a very high-density, reliable, non-volatile memory with infinite endurance. This ideal memory does not exist today, and it is unlikely it will ever exist. This project takes inspiration from the insect\u2019s nervous system. The general aim of DIVERSE is to enable learning from a very limited volume of noisy data based on imperfect, limited density, low endurance, resistive memories. Unlike digital systems, insects are not very good at performing precise calculations, but they excel at making extremely energy-efficient real time decisions by combining sensory data recorded in noisy environments. I thus propose to take inspiration from the well-studied cricket\u2019s nervous system and to use my experience and skills in resistive memories to develop a new technology that expresses robust cognitive behaviour while interacting with the environment. This cross-disciplinary work will lead to the fabrication of an innovative hardware/software platform with extremely high power efficiency and robust cognitive computing capabilities. This new technology will open new perspectives in dynamically developing areas including service and consumer robotics, implantable medical diagnostic microchips and wearable electronics.",

Novel brain-inspired or neuromorphic chips working with biologically-inspired spiking neural networks have gained attention as they promise highly efficient ways to process data. Important research effort has been dedicated to develop such neuromorphic systems in electronic or photonic hardware separately, each with its drawbacks and limitations. SPIKEPro proposes a science-towards-technology breakthrough by combining low-energy electrical and photonic neurons into a joint spiking neural network on an integrated circuit. SPIKEPro\u2019s chip integration approach is based on a common technology platform, connecting ultrafast laser optical neurons with efficient electrical spiking diodes through non-volatile synaptic weights. This enables to simultaneously capitalise on the advantages of both electronics and photonics to deliver efficient and high-speed SNNs going beyond existing implementations. In addition to reducing the energy consumption per spike in the network, SPIKEPro will also develop novel learning strategies and algorithms able to work with reduced number of synaptic connections. These will be possible by exploiting the hardware parameters of the electrical and photonic spiking devices. The outcome of SPIKEPro will have lasting economic, societal and scientific impact.

However, certain roadblocks keep the EU from assuming this leadership role: Edge processors need to become 100x more energy efficient; Their complexity demands automated design with 10x design time reduction; They must be secure and reliable to get accepted; Finally, they should be flexible and powerful to support the DL domain.\n\nCONVOLVE addresses these roadblocks and thereby enables EU leadership in Edge-AI. To that end, it will take a holistic approach with innovations at all design stack levels, including:\n1.ULP memristive circuits for computation-in-memory\n2.Fast compositional design of System-on-Chips (SoC)\n3.Transparent compilers supporting automated code optimizations and domain-specific languages\n4.Rethinking DL models through dynamic neural networks, event-based execution, and sparsity\n5.On-edge continuous learning for improved accuracy, self-healing, and reliable adaptation to non-stationary environments\n6.Holistic integration in SoCs supporting secure execution with real-time guarantees\n\nThe CONVOLVE consortium includes some of Europe's strongest research groups and industries, covering the whole design stack and value chain. In a community effort, we will demonstrate Edge-AI computing in real-life vision and audio domains.

Therefore, silicon hardware approaches for security primitives such as physical unclonable functions (PUFs) are currently investigated because of their absence of long-term digital memory storage. Although electronic PUFs have received major attention thanks to their native CMOS implementation, for secure authentication they are prone to machine learning and side-channel attacks due to their CMOS technology.\nThe NEUROPULS project aims to build next-generation low-power and secure edge-computing systems by developing novel photonic computing architectures and security layers based on photonic PUFs in augmented silicon photonics CMOS-compatible platforms. The integration of emerging non-volatile phase change materials for synapses/neurons and III-V materials for on-chip spiking sources, for the first time, will allow to build novel neuromorphic accelerators featuring RISC-V compliant interfaces for smooth adoption and programmability. Optimal performance will be achieved thanks to a novel full-system simulation platform for design space exploration. Three relevant use-cases will be considered for benchmarking to demonstrate 2 orders of magnitude energy efficiency improvement.",

During the last two decades, Neuromorphic computing has been implemented on electronics, with the most important circuit element capable of best mimicking neurons and synapses that is the memristor. Yet, constructing a highly interconnected networks of memristors to resemble biological architecture requires metal wires with extremely scaled area that results in an immense heat generation and power consumption, hindering the neuromorphic electronics development. Recently the new field of neuromorphic photonics has attracted a lot of interest as a valid alternative. In neuromorphic photonics the network connections are made of optical waveguide that provides inherent parallelism, ultra low latency, and almost zero power dissipation. However neuromorphic photonic will only meet its expectation as a groundbreaking technology when an Ideal photonic memristor is available. The ideal photonic memristor (currently missing) should adjust the amplitude of transmitted light in a non-volatile and analog manner, not via light absorption but through light phase change, to minimize the synapsis insertion losses. In this project I will demonstrate the low loss photonic memristor by innovative exploitation of energy band alignment and refractive index modulation of 2-Dimensional (2D) material heterostructures. I will embed the 2D heterostructure within a photonic integrated Mach- Zehnder Interferometer to showcase the non-volatile optical phase shifting with 1-10 fJ energy consumption per bit. This project will conduct interdisciplinary research across light-matter interaction, that requires contributions from materials science, physics, photonics and electronics. Positive outcome of this action will lead to a breakthrough in the development of neuromorphic photonics, thus a revolution in various aspects of smart human societies that rely on high throughput data computation.",

Learning algorithms are applied in an ever-increasing variety of contexts, ranging from engineering challenges such as self-driving cars all the way to societal contexts involving private data. These developments pose important challenges (i) Many of the recent breakthroughs demonstrate phenomena that lack explanations, and sometimes even contradict conventional wisdom. One main reason for this is because classical ML theory adopts a worst-case perspective which is too pessimistic to explain practical ML: in reality data is rarely worst-case, and experiments indicate that often much less data is needed than predicted by traditional theory. (ii) The increase in ML applications that involve private and sensitive data highlights the need for algorithms that handle the data responsibly. While this need has been addressed by the field of Differential Privacy (DP), the cost of privacy remains poorly understood: How much more data does private learning require, compared to learning without privacy constraints? Inspired by these challenges, our guiding question is:  How much data is needed for learning? Towards answering this question we aim to develop a theory of generalization which complements the traditional theory and is better fit to model real-world learning tasks. We will base it on distribution-, data-, and algorithm-dependent perspectives. These complement the  distribution-free worst-case perspective of the classical theory, and are suitable for exploiting specific properties of a given learning task. We will use this theory to study various settings, including supervised, semisupervised, interactive, and private learning. We believe that this research will advance the field in terms of efficiency, reliability, and applicability. Furthermore, our work combines ideas from various areas in computer science and mathematics; we thus expect further impact outside our field.",

This move will introduce significant new multidisciplinary research challenges emerging throughout the wireless communication protocol stacks, including the way the mobile network is modelled and deployed. The structure of 6G networks will be highly heterogeneous, densely deployed, and dynamic. Combined with the tight quality of services, such complex architecture will result in the untenability of legacy network operation routines. In response, artificial intelligence (AI), especially machine learning (ML), Semantic Communication and Digital Twin (DT) are emerging as solutions to realize the fully intelligent network orchestration and management. By learning from uncertain and dynamic environments, AI-enabled channel estimation and spectrum management will open up opportunities for bringing the excellent performance of Ultra-broadband techniques into full play. Additionally, challenges brought by Ultra-massive access concerning energy and security can be mitigated by applying AI-based approaches.\n \nThe overall research objective of the SCION project is to develop and design the network systems for seamless wireless access for Secure and Intelligent Massive Machine-to-Machine Communications for 6G. In addition to technology development, to meet the urgent needs for the future working force of the coming 6G era, this collaborative project will create a training network for Doctoral Candidates who will contribute to the design and implementation of future 6G networks.",

            "objective": "In parallel to the evolution of 5G communication systems, 6G concepts are being developed in the academic community. In 6G, several key technical enablers are envisioned: i) mmWave and THz frequencies electromagnetic with extremely large bandwidths, and extremely large antenna arrays; ii) reconfigurable intelligent surfaces that control the propagation environment; and iii) machine learning to solve problems for which mathematical models are not sufficient. As location-aware communication (i.e., to optimize network efficiency and communication capacity by exploiting location, map, and trajectory information) is already a part of 5G, we expect that the 6G key enablers will also lead to high-accuracy sensing and localization and, in turn, improve communication quality. The goal of this project is to develop integrated sensing, localization, and communication systems for 6G, and the project comprises the following 3 work packages (WPs). In WP1, joint parameter estimation methods for the 6G channel are studied, and low-complexity methods will be developed based on the inherent high resolution of the 6G channel. By exploiting the estimated channel parameters of 6G signals, novel methods for estimating user state as well as sensing the time-varying propagation environment will be developed in WP2. We will design methods to use sensing and localization information from WP2 for initial beam search, beamspace processing, beam alignment, and power allocation in WP3. In doing so, we address several of the fundamental challenges in 6G communications and high-accuracy sensing and localization.",

The situation has improved markedly in the past decade with the integration of first-order automatic theorem provers as backends. And recently, there have been exciting developments for more expressive logics, with the emergence of automatic provers based on optimized higher-order calculi. The Nekoka project's aim is to make higher-order SMT and \u03bb-superposition a perfect fit for logical problems emerging from the verification of software and mathematics. We will start by extending higher-order SMT and \u03bb-superposition and implementing them in automatic provers to provide push-button proof automation for lemmas expressed in higher-order logics. To reach end users, we will integrate the automatic provers in interactive tools: both general-purpose proof assistants and software verification platforms. As case studies, we will use our own provers and integrations to formalize quantum information theory and verify a big data framework in collaboration with domain experts. Beyond providing representative case studies, this will help build a user community around our tools and technologies. In terms of scientific impact, the improved higher-order SMT and \u03bb-superposition calculi will substantially advance the art of higher-order automation and help reorient research in automated reasoning towards the needs of end users, whether computer scientists or mathematicians. Our tools will outlive the project, serving end users and continuing to be useful for future research. At the societal level, the project will herald a future in which automatic provers and proof assistants are routinely deployed in tandem to verify critical computing infrastructure and to formalize research in computer science and mathematics, thereby leading to more trustworthy software and science.",

Applications range from performance improvements in the verification of safety-critical systems to the certification of famous, long, and hard-to-prove theorems. We propose using recently successful reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to learn proof strategies employed in vast ITP libraries and use them as generic methods to automate the ITP proving process. Specifically, the project aims to create a tactic for one of the most popular and automated ITPs, Isabelle/HOL, and train the RL algorithms with theorems from the two largest Isabelle libraries: HOL-Library and the Archive of Formal Proofs (AFP). We identify three gaps in the state of the art that such an RL-and-Isabelle approach would close and describe the work packages that will achieve the corresponding three research objectives. The project will be done under the guidance of Dr Josef Urban, who holds a Distinguished Researcher position at the Czech Institute of Informatics, Robotics and Cybernetics (CIIRC) within the Czech Technical University (CTU) in Prague. Dr Urban and the CIIRC group are experts in integrating machine learning (ML) and interactive theorem proving.

These huge models, often engineered by large corporations benefiting from huge computational resources, typically require learning a billion or more of parameters. They have proven to be very effective in solving prediction tasks in computer vision, natural language processing, and computational biology, for example, but they mostly remain black boxes that are hard to interpret, computationally demanding, and not robust to small data perturbations.\nWith a strong emphasis on visual modeling, the grand challenge of APHELEIA is to develop a new generation of machine learning models that are more robust, interpretable, and efficient, and do not require massive amounts of data to produce accurate predictions. To achieve this objective, we will foster new interactions between classical signal processing, statistics, optimization, and modern deep learning. Our goal is to reduce the need for massive data by enabling scientists and engineers to design trainable machine learning models that directly encode a priori knowledge of the task semantics and data formation process, while automatically prefering simple and stable solutions over complex ones. These models will be built on solid theoretical foundations with convergence and robustness guarantees, which are important to make real-life trustworthy predictions in the wild. We will implement these ideas in an open-source software toolbox readily applicable to visual recognition and inverse imaging problems, which will also handle other modalities. This will stimulate interdisciplinary collaborations, with the potential to be a game changer in the way scientists and engineers design machine learning problems.",

However, as machine learning models grow in capacity, they become increasingly \u2018black box\u2019, and it becomes harder for humans to reason about the patterns discovered by the machine. A root cause of this difficulty is that most machine learning models can express the same pattern in infinitely many, equally good, ways within their internal representations of the world. This is known as an identifiability problem.\n\nToday we lack a general solution to identifiability problems, and either give up on understanding the patterns discovered by the machine or reduce model complexity to lessen the problem. The latter also reduces the fidelity and applicability of the model. NoKnow rephrase the question of identifiability to be concerned with tasks solved by the representation rather than the representation itself. Using tools from differential geometry and Bayesian inference, we develop the theoretical tools to ensure that tasks solved in the representation have an identifiable outcome even if the representations themselves are not identifiable.\n\nTo turn theory into practice, we develop state-of-the-art algorithms for assessing the uncertainty of learned representations in order to indirectly estimate the topology of the representation manifold. We further develop novel, high-fidelity predictive models that have identifiable outcomes when trained on learned representations.\n\nNoKnow provides the fundamental tools needed to engage with learned representations to guarantee identifiable outcomes. This, in turn, increase trust in findings as they are not dependent on arbitrariness in learned representations. As society increasingly automates decisions, this trust in machine learning becomes ever more important.",

With their advent, much research has been devoted to finding them a first practical application. Focus on optimization, quantum chemistry and machine learning has been intense, and the developments are closely monitored by governments and industry alike. Variational algorithms in a classical-quantum feedback loop and adiabatic algorithms have been the dominant paradigm.

The main objectives are (A) to design experimentally-friendly protocols for quantum state preparation circumventing major existing bottlenecks (high number of repetitions, noise-induced barren plateaus...) and characterize broad families of states that can be prepared in a scalable way, (B) to develop a practical certification toolset amenable to near-term devices, with especial focus on the generation of certified randomness from a single NISQ device. The key idea is to use the hardness of many-body physics in a classical verifier-quantum prover interactive protocol. This approach will overcome the existing limitations of current approaches: it will be both easy to prepare and easy to verify (C) to overcome current hardware scalability limitations by combining several NISQ nodes into a small quantum network, and develop the appropriate theoretical framework to efficiently tailor and run quantum algorithms on them.",

However, many of these breakthroughs demonstrate phenomena that lack explanations, and sometimes even contradict conventional wisdom.  Perhaps the greatest mystery of modern ML---and arguably, one of the greatest mysteries of all of modern computer science---is the question of generalization: why do these immensely complex prediction rules successfully apply to future unseen instances?  Apart from the pure scientific curiosity it stimulates, I believe that this lack of understanding poses a significant obstacle to widening the applicability of ML to critical applications, like in healthcare or autonomous driving, where the cost of error is disastrous.  The broad goal of this project is to tackle the generalization mystery in the context of both statistical learning and reinforcement learning, focusing on optimization algorithms being the de facto contemporary standard in training learning models.  Our methodology points out to inherent shortcomings of widely accepted viewpoints with regard to generalization of optimization-based learning algorithms, and takes a crucially different approach that targets the optimization algorithm itself; building bottom-up from fundamental and tractable optimization models, we identify intrinsic properties and develop algorithmic methodologies that enable optimization to effectively generalize in modern statistical- and reinforcement-learning scenarios.  A successful outcome would not only lead to a timely and crucial shift in the way the research community approaches generalization of contemporary optimization-based ML, but it may also significantly transform the way we develop practical, efficient and reliable learning systems.",

However, most of the machines used are black boxes, and the causal relation between inputs and outputs is often impossible to extract. Nonetheless, a critical aspect when dealing with physical systems is not only to make correct predictions, but to understand the physical laws which underlie these assessments. Recently, an increasing number of works aim at developing interpretable ML methods, from which such hidden laws can be extracted. However, their application to physics has been often limited to supervised and unsupervised learning approaches.\nThe aim of this project is: 1) construct an interpretable reinforcement learning method; 2) extract hidden rules and features in timely and paramount problems in physics. The method combines three well-established concepts of ML: projective simulation, graph neural networks (GNN) and hidden variable disentanglement. PS provides interpretable RL agents that can be trained for a variety of tasks, from the construction of quantum experiments, via skill acquisition in robotics, to the modelling of honeybee colonies. By enhancing their learning power and interpretability with GNNs and variable disentanglement, we will extract the hidden features of the systems the RL agents have interacted with and ultimately, the physical laws governing them. In particular, we will tackle problems in the field of condensed matter, where particles diffuse either passively or actively, to reach a target state. Moreover, we will consider ensembles of RL agents, so as to analyze not only the physical properties of the systems, but also their interactions and communication dynamics in the quest of a common target.\nThe originality of the proposal is directly related to: 1) the methods that will be developed; 2) the systems of study; 3) most importantly, the information we will access and discover with the interpretable RL agents.",

Minor Objectives or Methods: Both projects focus on machine learning and reinforcement learning (RL), but OPTGEN aims to optimize generalization in ML, while ALEPH aims to develop interpretable RL for physical systems. This makes their objectives only partially overlapping. (1 point)\n\n2. Overlapping Goals, Methodologies, or Innovations: Both explore innovations in RL, but OPTGEN emphasizes optimizing for generalization across ML applications, and ALEPH focuses more on extracting interpretable physical laws via RL. They overlap in utilizing RL but differ in their specific goals and contexts. (1 point)\n\n3. Key Similarities in Scope, Methodology, and Innovation: Both projects utilize advanced ML methodologies, focus on innovation, and share common goals regarding improving the understanding of learning processes. However, the primary applications (generalization in ML versus interpretability in physics) ensure that the independent research paths are still meaningful. Retaining their distinctions might be beneficial as they target different end goals and industries. Merging them may yield moderate benefit but not substantial enough to mandate merging.

Closely Align in Scope, Methodology, and Innovation (No Points): While both projects contribute to machine learning advances, the domains of application and specific research questions are distinct enough that they don't align closely in scope and methodology. Merging could improve some aspects of resource efficiency, but they could still successfully function separately without major loss.\n\n5. Nearly Identical (No Points): The projects are distinct enough in their end goals and methods that they do not warrant a perfect match.

As location-aware communication (i.e., to optimize network efficiency and communication capacity by exploiting location, map, and trajectory information) is already a part of 5G, we expect that the 6G key enablers will also lead to high-accuracy sensing and localization and, in turn, improve communication quality. The goal of this project is to develop integrated sensing, localization, and communication systems for 6G, and the project comprises the following 3 work packages (WPs). In WP1, joint parameter estimation methods for the 6G channel are studied, and low-complexity methods will be developed based on the inherent high resolution of the 6G channel. By exploiting the estimated channel parameters of 6G signals, novel methods for estimating user state as well as sensing the time-varying propagation environment will be developed in WP2.

The differences among patients and the heterogeneous and plastic nature of each individual tumour have resulted in all therapeutic clinical trials failing during the past 20 years. Recently, immunotherapy has been showing great promise, but only in subsets of patients. Identifying those patients cannot be done a priori as biomarkers are still largely missing, nor are we able to follow-up on therapeutic efficacy when patients get treated. The GLIOMATCH project aims at improving the clinical outcome of GBM/pHGG patients by enabling immunology-based patient stratification to empower personalised matching of appropriate immunotherapy, while improving follow-up of clinical responses to existing/novel therapeutics. This will be achieved by integrating spatially resolved, multi-layered tissue maps (using integrated single-cell multiomics), with non-invasive MRI images. This integration will fuel into a novel MRI Radio-multiomics hub, that will be made available to clinical professionals through which they can perform tumour-host based patient stratification and personalised therapy matching while interpreting longitudinal follow-up and treatment efficacy. The proposed data-driven models will be developed by analysing the largest cohort of immuno-oncology (I/O) treated GBM/pHGG patients (n>300, including pre-post treatment samples) with matched controls (n>300) and exceptionally long-term surviving GBM patients (n~140), in which various tumour-host niches will be studied in how they respond to I/O perturbations and lead to improved clinical outcome. This will be empowered by deploying an UNCAN-compatible data lake, to which incremental data collection will be used to further refine the machine learning models, while proposing novel treatment options.

Adoption of AI-based support systems in such applications is however minimal, chiefly due to the difficulty of assessing their assumptions, limitations and intentions. In order to realise the promise of AI for individuals, society and economy, people should feel they can trust AIs in terms of reliability, capacity to understand the human\u2019s needs, and guarantees that they are genuinely aiming at helping them. TANGO will develop the theoretical basis and computational framework for hybrid decision support systems (HDSS) in which humans and machines are aligned in terms of values and goals, know their respective strengths, and work together to reach an optimal decision. To this end, TANGO will develop: 1) A cognitive theory of mutual understanding and hybrid decision making, of intuitive vs deliberative approaches to decision making and of how they affect our trust in human and AI teammates. 2) Cognition-aware explainable AIs implementing synergistic human-machine interaction, enabling machines to determine what information a specific decision maker (e.g., layperson vs expert) needs, or does not need, to reach an informed decision. 3) A \"Human-in-the-loop\" co-evolution of human decision making and machine learning models building on bi-directional, explanation-augmented interlocution. The TANGO framework will be evaluated on four high impact use cases, namely supporting: i) women during pregnancy and postpartum, ii) surgical teams in intraoperative decision making, iii) loan officers and applicants in credit lending decision processes, and iv) public policy makers in designing incentives and allocating funds. Success in these case studies will establish TANGO as the framework of reference for developing a new generation of synergistic AI systems, and will strengthen the leadership of Europe in human-centric AI.",

Clinical risks of HF can vary from reduced cardiac function and regular hospitalisations, all the way to cardiac events and mortality. There is a need for a personalised medicine approach to tailor the care models (i.e. lifestyle changes, medications, interventions) to each HF patient\u2019s risk profile and hence optimise the clinical outcomes. Artificial intelligence (AI) solutions trained from multi-source cardiovascular data have the potential to dissect the precise characteristics of each patient and predict their likely trajectories at an early stage. However, existing AI methods remain a far distance from clinical transfer and adoption due to a common and key limitation: their trustworthiness and acceptance by cardiologists and patients alike have not been achieved.\n\nAI4HF will develop the first trustworthy AI solutions for personalised risk assessment and management of HF patients. The project will build on a unique set of big data repositories, trustworthy AI methods, computational tools and clinical results from major EU-funded projects in cardiology. To test robustness, fairness, transparency, usability and transferability, the validation with take place in eight clinical centres in both high- and low-to-middle-income countries in the EU and internationally. AI4HF will develop a comprehensive and standardised methodological framework for trustworthy and ethical AI development and evaluation based on the FUTURE-AI guidelines developed by the consortium members.

It is a complex clinical syndrome presenting with impaired heart function and is associated with poor quality of life for patients and high healthcare costs. There is a high clinical demand for novel artificial intelligence (AI) tools which will facilitate risk stratification, early diagnosis, and disease progression assessment in HF. Such tools are essential to allow prompt initiation of evidence-based prevention and treatment strategies which will improve patient quality of life, reduce morbidity and mortality and the HF burden on healthcare. \nSTRATIFYHF aims to develop, validate and implement the first AI-based, decision support system (DSS) for risk stratification, early diagnosis, and disease progression assessment in HF to accommodate both primary and secondary care clinical needs. The DSS will integrate patient-specific demographic and clinical data using existing and novel technologies and establish AI-based tools for risk stratification and HF prediction using machine learning. Additionally, a mobile app will be developed to empower patients to better manage their condition, and health care professionals to make informed decision in selection of evidence-based HF prevention and treatment strategies. \nOur multidisciplinary consortium, including three small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) and two stakeholder organisations, will be guided by medical advice and regulatory and health technology experts to deliver the DSS as a medical class 2b device, reaching TRL 8 by the end of the project.

MultiOpStruct aims to deliver an integrated design environment capable of addressing these concerns by adopting a highly inter-disciplinary methodology inspired by the 'material-by-design' outlook; and greatly expanding the current state-of-the-art by coordinating cutting edge research. On the modelling side, the work will develop a novel, rapid and high-fidelity physics-based method custom fit for analysing such complex components. On the design side, the project will deliver the first ever Hybrid Multiscale-Artificial Intelligence Topology Optimization toolbox for multifunctional lightweight Additively Manufactured (AM) Composite structures with increased durability and thermal-vibro-acoustic isolation; and decreased net-costs. This will reduce fuel dependency and associated emissions - and subsequently alleviate problems induced by climate change, e.g., glacier retreat. These goals are strongly aligned with the Circular Economic Action Plan, European Green Deal and Fit for 55 policy. For succesful completion, the proposed research plan brings together an enthusiastic and talented researcher with expertise in computational mechanics with an interdisciplinary team of internationally recognized research groups in applied mechanics and Additive Manufacturing.",

Heating and cooling represent today 46% of EU energy system, that is, more than 5700 TWh, out of which, only 18% are produced with renewable sources of heating. To exploit the geothermal for energy balancing at scale, it is essential to focus on the best use of low to medium temperature resources because Europe possesses mostly low-enthalpy resources at temperature ranging from 110oC to 170oC and they are predominantly found in sedimentary formations such as the Pannonian Basin or the Upper Rhein Graben. EGS based geothermal can be developed anywhere across the EU.\nLow to medium temperature geothermal field developed based on either hydrothermal resources or EGS can be technically exploited by binary or ORC plant for power generation. Flexible ORC operation to produce load following power is economically challenging. nGEL is aiming to transform a geothermal ORC plant to a flexible tri-generation plant capable of both efficiently as well as cost effectively responding to the dynamic demand of power, heating, and cooling, attributing geothermal energy as a dispatchable source to balance the power and thermal grid against the progressive integration of intermittent RES (i.e., solar, wind). This will be achieved through the integration of absorption chiller, thermal energy storage, cold thermal energy storage, heat exchangers, smart control and energy management system (EMS) with AI functionalities. EMS will schedule the production and distribution of power, heat and cooling by interacting day-ahead market, grid operator, and analysing predicted energy demand and prices.\nIf the nGEL technology can be implemented in all of the existing ORC plants in the EU,  around 215 TWht heat can be delivered to the thermal grid, which is approximately 4% of the EU current annual heat demand, which corresponds to annual economic saving (on NG import) of \u20ac 9.6 billion/year.",

AI has been rapidly growing in various industries, from financial services to healthcare, education, and job recruitment. However, as AI algorithms have become increasingly sophisticated and pervasive in decision-making processes, concerns have arisen about their fairness and compliance with regulations. In particular, the EU AI Act requires that AI providers in high-risk applications -- such as employment, credit, or healthcare -- to identify (and thereby address) discrimination by their algorithms against certain demographics of people. However, ensuring compliance with the Act can be challenging, particularly for AI startups that may not have the resources or expertise to fully understand and implement the Act's requirements. Addressing existing disconnects between AI fairness toolkits' capabilities and current practitioner needs, the Act.AI tool can be easily integrated into any AI workflow, in a plug and play fashion, to continuously monitor and improve its fairness. A key aspect of Act.AI is the ability to operate with different types of data (tabular, images, and text) in a variety of contexts (binary and multiclass classification and regression). It is also able to match datasets in different domains including out-of-distribution data even if these datasets have different numbers of variables or features. To ensure usability of Act.AI, it will integrate feedback from relevant stakeholders from two immediate target markets: financial service and healthcare.",

The tools will be validated in six clinical sites on CVD and serve as the basis for a lasting interdisciplinary platform for distributed learning in other vascular territories. AI-POD will push the boundaries of clinical insight in CVD in obese persons, including its treatment and risk management. AI-POD main outcomes are (1) a novel imaging-based AI-based risk score and Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) for the risk assessment and prediction of obesity-related CVD and associated complications as a pre-requiste for further AI-based prevention and treatment management; (2) an innovative, easy-to-use mobile app for citizens (Citizen App) that interacts with the CDSS empowering obese people to better monitor and manage their own health.

Stemness of neoplastic cells has been proposed as a major factor in treatment resistance and high relapse rates, however, drugs targeting stem cell signaling pathways in cancer are still lacking today. We propose developing and validating a new drug discovery platform based on patient-derived organoids (PDOs) and machine learning-assisted phenotypic target validation and drug discovery. Using this platform, we have previously shown that we can identify a broad spectrum of phenotypes beyond lethality, including drug-induced changes in stemness of PDOs. As part of the EIC Open Transition project, we will validate our next-generation platform for identifying therapeutics to target stem cell signaling pathways in CRC. Based on results by us showing that an interaction of MEK and Wnt signaling shifts the balance between stemness and differentiated cells, we will target Wnt pathways as a demonstrator for the technology.

Identifying CRC early enables better treatment options. Screening usually entails a quantitative faecal immunological test (FIT) to predict the need of colonoscopy for the detection of colorectal lesions, an expensive and invasive procedure. We aim to predict this need with specificity increased by >20 percentage points by using metagenomic microbiomes. We hypothesise that computational microbiome profiles extracted using artificial intelligence (Al) technology will allow for optimised personal therapy stratification. However, clinicians do not have access to broad microbiome data. With Microb-AI-ome, we will develop a novel kind of computational stratification technology to enable microbiome-enhanced precision medicine of CRC. Metagenomic microbiome data to date is distributed over many national registries, and privacy regulations are hindering its effective integration. With Microb-AI-ome, we will overcome this barrier by establishing the first privacy-preserving federated big data network in CRC research. We will integrate isolated, national databases into one international federated database network - rather than a cloud - covering metagenomes for over 5,000 individuals screened for CRC, and an expected total of 100,000 by 2026.

However, currently existing synaptic transistors have been developed using electrolytes that are by nature unstable and difficult to integrate such as ionic liquids or proton conducting polymers. \n\nTRANSIONICS will deliver highly stable (non-volatile), silicon-compatible and scalable solid state synaptic transistors by exploiting the first-ever room temperature oxide-ionic electrolyte developed in the ERC CoG grant (ULTRASOFC) held by the PI. TRANSIONICS transistors are able to modulate its channel properties with external stimulus like real neurons by reducing/oxidizing a mixed ionic-electronic conductor unveiled at ULTRASOFC. Additionally, TRANSIONICS is compatible with mainstream microelectronics fabrication technology, which makes it ideal for developing high density brain-like computer chips.\n\nThe goals of the TRANSIONICS project are i) to evaluate the technical feasibility for the fabrication of unique all-solid-oxide synaptic transistors with lateral architecture; ii) to assess the silicon- compatibility and scalability of the TRANSIONICS transistors; iii) to define an IPR strategy for technology transfer; iv) to build a value proposition for a startup company and to identify customer segments with industrial partners.

The synaptic connections play a paramount role to create better hardware realizations of these networks. However, it is very complex to realize large interconnectivity by electronic circuitry. COSPIN overcomes this connectivity constraint by using the eigen-excitations of the magnetic system - the spin waves - to connect state-of-the-art artificial neurons based on spintronic auto-oscillators.  COSPIN\u2019S main goal is to create and experimentally validate innovative physical building blocks for a novel nano-scaled, all-spintronic network structure which incorporates all necessary properties for neuromorphic computing including high nonlinearity, interconnectivity and reprogrammability.  By design, COSPIN works at the boundary between oscillator-based computing and wave-based computing. It uses interference, frequency-multiplexing, and time-modulation techniques as well as spin-wave amplification to significantly increase the connectivity between neurons. Reprogramming of the network is implemented by a direct physical link to magnetic memory solutions as well as by reconfiguring spin-wave circuits. By using coherent wave interference and nonlinear wave interaction, COSPIN paves the way for novel coupling phenomena for complex artificial neural networks far beyond the state-of-the-art of current hardware realizations. Using cutting-edge micromagnetic simulations enhanced by inverse design methods, the artificial networks will be designed and tested prior to their nano-fabrication. Experimental investigations will be mainly carried out using micro-focus Brillouin light scattering. This allows for local investigation of the individual neurons and synapses, and significantly simplifies the interpretation of the network dynamics.",

These processes exhibit behaviours that can only be accurately represented by means of nonlinear models (thus, complex) with sampling periods of  micro to milliseconds, which means that decision-making should be done under such time. These systems only operate satisfactorily when adequate control methodologies are used, taking into account performance goals, operational constraints and physical metrics. Thus, this project focuses on the development of real-time optimisation for control, using the Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework.\nMPC is a very established approach, centred on generating decision actions by solving an optimisation problem. Over the last decades, considerable scientific effort has been devoted to the study of MPC, expounding its vast pertinence. Yet, applying MPC with nonlinear models issues increased digital complexity, typically incompatible with real-time environments. The standard practice consists in applying approximated solvers, which are not reproducible nor optimal.\nRecent works have shown an alternative to render real-time capable algorithms: designing nonlinear MPC using the Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) toolkit. Even though the theoretical side of LPV MPC is presumably established, and several results indicate competitiveness against state-of-the-art solvers, the translation to a practically-viable tool is not yet rendered universal. That is, a ready-for-application MPC solver, using LPV representations, is not yet available. Accordingly, the main goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive real-time optimisation solver, based on LPV MPC. Such a tool would ensure optimality, representation exactness, and generate control laws within the microsecond range, contributing as a technological advance oriented to modern application of social concern.",

It has a broad application horizon across various engineering domains and industries.\n\nOn the other hand, REALOPT4CONTROL is dedicated to developing a real-time optimization solver based on the Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) toolkit for nonlinear MPC applications. It emphasizes the need for micro to millisecond-level decision-making for systems with complex dynamics, like renewable smart grids and autonomous vehicles. The project aims to produce a ready-for-application MPC solver with high computational efficiency, which is a more focused and technically intensive goal compared to SysDyNetTool.\n\nMerging the projects might yield moderate benefits in terms of resource efficiency and shared knowledge but could dilute the specific innovations and targeted outcomes each project aims to achieve. Therefore, they should remain independent, as the distinct approaches and target outputs are likely to benefit from focused, individual development paths.",

            "objective": "The artificial intelligence community, inspired by the tremendous progress made in neuroscience, has recently proposed powerful algorithms to enable effective real-time decision making based on a limited volume of noisy sensory data. However, implementing such algorithms in low-power devices remains a challenge due to the energy inefficiency that comes from separating logic and memory in current electronic systems. For the past 10 years, research groups have been developing alternative electronic components and systems, such as brain inspired computing architectures and novel resistive memory technologies to address this design bottleneck. The critical feature for these new technologies to perform at their best is a very high-density, reliable, non-volatile memory with infinite endurance. This ideal memory does not exist today, and it is unlikely it will ever exist. This project takes inspiration from the insect\u2019s nervous system. The general aim of DIVERSE is to enable learning from a very limited volume of noisy data based on imperfect, limited density, low endurance, resistive memories. Unlike digital systems, insects are not very good at performing precise calculations, but they excel at making extremely energy-efficient real time decisions by combining sensory data recorded in noisy environments. I thus propose to take inspiration from the well-studied cricket\u2019s nervous system and to use my experience and skills in resistive memories to develop a new technology that expresses robust cognitive behaviour while interacting with the environment. This cross-disciplinary work will lead to the fabrication of an innovative hardware/software platform with extremely high power efficiency and robust cognitive computing capabilities. This new technology will open new perspectives in dynamically developing areas including service and consumer robotics, implantable medical diagnostic microchips and wearable electronics.",

One of the most prominent solutions is the deployment of cross-disciplinary resources for mimicking the performance of a Human Brain, also known as neuromorphic computing. It relies on electronic components that could replicate the functioning of neurons and synapses. Designing such novel electronics needs the development of cost-effective, fast and reliable materials with tunable functionality. A fundamental understanding of these materials will pave the foundation of innovative device designs and strategies for their large-scale integration for neuromorphic architectures. In this context, the proposed project intends to deliver artificial neurons by developing thin-films of a novel material (TbMnO3) that is capable of demonstrating a Negative Differential Resistance (NDR). The idea is to utilise the fundamental understanding of multi-dimensional (electrical, optical, mechanical and magnetic) control of NDR which is not explored yet and is possible in TbMnO3. NDR enables a two-terminal device to display self-oscillations due to applied electrical spikes. The spiking electrical currents could be used to govern the behaviour of these oscillations and emulating the leaky, integrate, and fire behaviour of biological neurons. Once such a performance is achieved, the device will further be integrated into oscillatory neural networks array for demonstration of complex computing tasks such as image recognition and imitating human behaviour.    \n\nThe project will unite the applicant\u2019s expertise in synaptic devices and materials engineering with the extensive experience of the host-labs in thin-film and neuromorphic devices.

The objective of this project is then to design, fabricate, and characterize field-free memristive synapses using Gd-based ferrimagnets. We will use two approaches: all-optical magnetic switching and the use of multiferroics to switch the magnetization by the application of electric fields. By taking advantage of the unique properties of ferrimagnets, ultrafast and energy efficient magnetic switching, we aim to develop highly efficient synapses that exhibit memristive behavior without the need for an external magnetic field.",

The synaptic connections play a paramount role to create better hardware realizations of these networks. However, it is very complex to realize large interconnectivity by electronic circuitry. COSPIN overcomes this connectivity constraint by using the eigen-excitations of the magnetic system - the spin waves - to connect state-of-the-art artificial neurons based on spintronic auto-oscillators.  COSPIN\u2019S main goal is to create and experimentally validate innovative physical building blocks for a novel nano-scaled, all-spintronic network structure which incorporates all necessary properties for neuromorphic computing including high nonlinearity, interconnectivity and reprogrammability.  By design, COSPIN works at the boundary between oscillator-based computing and wave-based computing. It uses interference, frequency-multiplexing, and time-modulation techniques as well as spin-wave amplification to significantly increase the connectivity between neurons. Reprogramming of the network is implemented by a direct physical link to magnetic memory solutions as well as by reconfiguring spin-wave circuits. By using coherent wave interference and nonlinear wave interaction, COSPIN paves the way for novel coupling phenomena for complex artificial neural networks far beyond the state-of-the-art of current hardware realizations. Using cutting-edge micromagnetic simulations enhanced by inverse design methods, the artificial networks will be designed and tested prior to their nano-fabrication. Experimental investigations will be mainly carried out using micro-focus Brillouin light scattering. This allows for local investigation of the individual neurons and synapses, and significantly simplifies the interpretation of the network dynamics.",

            "objective": "This project proposes the functionalisation of dense arrays of spintronic nanodevices called magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) for neuromorphic computing application. Neuromorphic computing is a field that proposes a novel computing architecture aimed at reducing energy consumption and enhancing computational capabilities compared to conventional computers. It mimics the Human brain where memory and information processing are physically intertwined. One key component is the synapse, which plays a crucial role in enabling the communication between neurons and serving as a dynamic, plastic memory where the strength of connections between neurons is stored. This characteristic allows for tuning these connections in a non-volatile and reversible manner, forming the foundation for intricate learning and memory processes.\n\nFor this purpose, the field of spintronics will be employed, focusing on controlling electron spin. Spintronics has gained significant importance in data storage applications, and spintronics nanodevices such as MTJs have recently emerged as promising candidates for neuromorphic computing due to their robustness, multifunctionalities and compatibility with compatibility to metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology. They hold strong appeal for the development of artificial synapses and neurons that mimic their biological counterparts due to their low power consumption and fast switching compared to traditional transistors. In addition, the nanoscale size of spintronic devices allows for the creation of large neural networks. The integration of memory and processing in these devices has the potential to revolutionize computational systems and strongly reduce energy consumption while increasing computational speed.",

However, many of these breakthroughs demonstrate phenomena that lack explanations, and sometimes even contradict conventional wisdom.  Perhaps the greatest mystery of modern ML---and arguably, one of the greatest mysteries of all of modern computer science---is the question of generalization: why do these immensely complex prediction rules successfully apply to future unseen instances?  Apart from the pure scientific curiosity it stimulates, I believe that this lack of understanding poses a significant obstacle to widening the applicability of ML to critical applications, like in healthcare or autonomous driving, where the cost of error is disastrous.  The broad goal of this project is to tackle the generalization mystery in the context of both statistical learning and reinforcement learning, focusing on optimization algorithms being the de facto contemporary standard in training learning models.  Our methodology points out to inherent shortcomings of widely accepted viewpoints with regard to generalization of optimization-based learning algorithms, and takes a crucially different approach that targets the optimization algorithm itself; building bottom-up from fundamental and tractable optimization models, we identify intrinsic properties and develop algorithmic methodologies that enable optimization to effectively generalize in modern statistical- and reinforcement-learning scenarios.  A successful outcome would not only lead to a timely and crucial shift in the way the research community approaches generalization of contemporary optimization-based ML, but it may also significantly transform the way we develop practical, efficient and reliable learning systems.",

Indeed, Deep Reinforcement Learning (deep RL), which has recently led to AI breakthroughs in computer games, has been publicized as the learning-based approach to robotics. To date, however, deep RL studies focused on known and observable systems, where uncertainty was resolved by lengthy trial and error. Quickly learning to act in novel environments, as required for robotics, is not yet within our reach.\nThe crux of the matter is the tight coupling between perception and control under high uncertainty -- the robot must actively reduce uncertainty while also trying to solve the task; for complex and high-dimensional systems, we do not have a suitable algorithmic framework for this.\n\nIn this proposal, our overarching goal is to: \nDevelop the algorithmic framework of using deep learning in problems that tightly couple perception, planning, and control, for advancing robotic AI to reliably manipulate general objects in unstructured environments.\n\nTowards this end, we shall develop neural network representations of uncertainty, and algorithms that estimate uncertainty from data. We will develop theory and algorithms for decision making under uncertainty, bringing in a fresh perspective to the problem based on Bayesian reinforcement learning (Bayes-RL).

This is primarily due to thrombosis, luminal scar formation, and infection. In our ground-breaking new AVG, biomimicking zwitterions prevent thrombosis, drug delivery prevents scar formation and infection, and an ECM coating ensures fast tissue integration allowing early HD.\nSmart: TELEGRAFT comprises two diagnostic tools to monitor and prevent device complication. Pressure transmitters are used to monitor blood flow and optical sensors to detect inflammation and infections. The data is processed by AI machine learning models and displayed in an easy to understand dashboard for healthcare professionals. The data allows online telemonitoring and consultations by remote healthcare professionals. This makes home dialysis safe for patients, even in areas with poor infrastructure, where patients live far from HD clinics.\nSurgical implantation: The TELEGRAFT system will be demonstrated in an operational environment through a 2-stage randomized clinical trial enrolling 60 patients at 5 hospitals across Europe and through a home HD field study.\nResource constrained setting: (1) In low and middle income countries, TELEGRAFT will substitute complicated and expensive kidney transplantation and allow simpler and cheap implantation of AVG for HD. (2) TELEGRAFT is the only solution with diagnostic tools allowing real-time online detection and remote monitoring of complications and device failure.

            "objective": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is estimated to affect more than 840 million people worldwide constituting a major global health crisis. Clinically, the number of CKD patients will continue to rise mostly because of the ageing population and the increased prevalence of comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension. In Europe, around 100,000 million people are affected by it. According to the gloomy predictions, Europe is at risk of a dismal increase of CKD patients as well as costs to healthcare systems. Patients with advanced CKD display a loss of kidney function leading to a blood accumulation of, a.o. protein-bound uremic toxins (PBUTs) that are poorly eliminated by renal replacement therapies. This systemic retention known as the uremic syndrome affects other organs. Indeed, neurologic complications such as blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption have been reported in CKD patients. The BBB guarantees the exchange between the blood and the brain through a complex cellular organization and a diverse range of transport proteins mediates the movement of endo/exogenous compounds. \nI hypothesize that impairment of kidney tubular functionality in CKD causes an alteration of BBB integrity and function. This results in an aberrant BBB pass-through of PBUTs as well as impacts BBB vectorial transport capabilities. This fellowship aims to develop an appropriate multi-organs-on-chip device to accurately describe (i) the impact of PBUTs on BBB integrity and functionality, and (ii) the involvement of kidney-brain axis dysfunction in PBUTs-driven BBB disruption. We will develop a bioprinting-based microfluidic BBB-on-chip to accurately study BBB permeability, architecture, and transport function. This device will be connected to our established proximal tubule-on-chip to form a robust (kidney-brain) multi-organs-on-chip system. This project will pave the way toward the establishment of new and effective CKD therapies, and an expert system for pharmacology studies in a near future.",

One of the main obstacles that prevent AM from expanding its application towards fulfilling the requisites of sustainability and green manufacturing, is poor fatigue resistance of AM material caused by multiple intrinsic surface and internal defects. \nCurrently, different post-processing treatments are being used to tackle this challenge by enhancing surface regularity and reducing bulk defects. Despite the enhancement of fatigue resistance after the aforementioned treatments, these are additional steps that result in longer production times and higher costs. Moreover, due to the complexity of geometry and size, sometimes AM components cannot be easily post-processed by regular treatments. \nOptimizing the AM processes aiming at maximized fatigue life is a plausible solution that significantly minimizes the need for post-processing. However, the main barrier here is the lack of accurate, fast, and economic prediction tools to correlate fatigue life directly to AM process parameters. FLAME will address the aforementioned needs and pave the way towards efficient fatigue life assessment of AM via developing a hybrid framework through the association of physics-based models and machine learning approaches.

Deep learning applications usually require vast amounts of computing resources but microelectronics are encountering physically fundamental bottlenecks in speed, energy consumption, heating, and interconnect delay, which can no longer be resolved by scaling. The end of Moore\u2019s law urgently calls for the introduction of new devices, new integration technologies, and new architectures to efficiently accelerate deep learning applications. Recently, optical neural networks (ONNs) based on photonic integrated circuits have shown great potential as an emerging computing architecture beyond von Neumann and Moore to overcome the bottlenecks in their microelectronics counterparts. Yet the ONN concepts and demonstrations so far are encountering severe obstacles such as limited calculation precision, repeatability, scalability, and compatibility with microelectronics. These obstacles are deeply rooted in the analogue computing architecture of the existing ONNs: insufficient signal-to-noise ratio due to accumulated noise and crosstalk in the system. \nDOLORES aims to explore and develop a radically new digital optical computing platform to create a new class of processors, namely a digital optical neural network (DONN) processor, that is fundamentally different from any ONN scheme and solves the aforementioned obstacles. Integrating the best of photonics and electronics, DOLORES is expected to revolutionize optical computing, and in the long-term vision enable new possibilities that are barely supported by today\u2019s computing hardware. If successful, DOLORES can pave the way for a new era in AI, drastically accelerating neural networks and deep learning applications, which have the potential to transform many sectors of our society, including healthcare, finance, and transportation.",

Most of its successes are achieved by increasingly large neural networks that are trained on massive data sets. Their development inflicts costs that are only affordable by a few labs and prevent global participation in the creation of related technologies. The huge model sizes also pose computational challenges for algorithms that aim to address issues with features that are critical in real-world applications like fairness, adversarial robustness, and interpretability. The high demand of neural networks for vast amounts of data further limits their utility for solving highly relevant tasks in biomedicine, economics, or natural sciences.\nTo democratize deep learning and to broaden its applicability, we have to find ways to learn small-scale models. With this end in view, we will promote sparsity at multiple stages of the machine learning pipeline and identify models that are scaleable, resource- and data-efficient, robust to noise, and provide insights into problems. To achieve this, we need to overcome two challenges: the identification of trainable sparse network structures and the de novo optimization of small-scale models.\nThe solutions that we propose combine ideas from statistical physics, complex network science, and machine learning. Our fundamental innovations rely on the insight that neural networks are a member of a cascade model class that we made analytically tractable on random graphs. Advancing our derivations will enable us to develop novel parameter initialization, regularization, and reparameterization methods that will compensate for the missing implicit benefits of overparameterization for learning. The significant reduction in model size achieved by our methods will help unlock the full potential of deep learning to serve society as a whole.",

In the criminal procedural field, AI is enhancing the efficiency of law enforcement authorities and criminal justice systems in both preventing and prosecuting crimes, through the streamlining of tasks like data analysis, evidence assessment, and crime prediction.

An additional factor hindering a responsible and beneficial implementation of AI in the criminal procedural sector is that some technical characteristics of the AI prototypes developed so far (e.g. opacity) interfere with some criminal procedural principles and standards. The lack of dialogue between legal scholarship and scientific community prevents the identification of suitable technical solutions. Given this scenario, managing the legal and ethical implications of AI in the criminal justice system proves to be a prohibitive challenge.

The fellows will benefit from world-class scientific programs, quality supervision and industrial secondments and also from personalized career development activities and transferable skills training (interpersonal, communication, digital, entrepreneurship, open science, gender, ethics). DeMythif.AI\u2019s strength lies in its diversity permitting to fine-tune the content offered to the fellows from a professional perspective. It ultimately allows concretizing dynamic research collaborations and developing strong synergies around the academic and industrial community, opening new perspectives beyond the project.",

Adoption of AI-based support systems in such applications is however minimal, chiefly due to the difficulty of assessing their assumptions, limitations and intentions. In order to realise the promise of AI for individuals, society and economy, people should feel they can trust AIs in terms of reliability, capacity to understand the human\u2019s needs, and guarantees that they are genuinely aiming at helping them. TANGO will develop the theoretical basis and computational framework for hybrid decision support systems (HDSS) in which humans and machines are aligned in terms of values and goals, know their respective strengths, and work together to reach an optimal decision. To this end, TANGO will develop: 1) A cognitive theory of mutual understanding and hybrid decision making, of intuitive vs deliberative approaches to decision making and of how they affect our trust in human and AI teammates. 2) Cognition-aware explainable AIs implementing synergistic human-machine interaction, enabling machines to determine what information a specific decision maker (e.g., layperson vs expert) needs, or does not need, to reach an informed decision. 3) A \"Human-in-the-loop\" co-evolution of human decision making and machine learning models building on bi-directional, explanation-augmented interlocution. The TANGO framework will be evaluated on four high impact use cases, namely supporting: i) women during pregnancy and postpartum, ii) surgical teams in intraoperative decision making, iii) loan officers and applicants in credit lending decision processes, and iv) public policy makers in designing incentives and allocating funds. Success in these case studies will establish TANGO as the framework of reference for developing a new generation of synergistic AI systems, and will strengthen the leadership of Europe in human-centric AI.",

This necessarily creates information-transmission bottlenecks at the interface between quantum and classical realms. These bottlenecks create scalability issues that prevent us from using existing architectures to the best of their capabilities and may even impair our ability to further scale up system sizes.\n\nIn this project, we adopt a unifying framework that takes into account all computing resources (quantum and classical). We develop quantum-to-classical converters to overcome information-transmission bottlenecks. Dubbed shadows, they leverage randomization, as well as quantum-enhanced readout strategies to obtain a succinct classical description of an underlying quantum system that can then be used to efficiently predict many features at once. The shadow paradigm is compatible with near-term quantum hardware and utilizes genuine quantum effects that do not have a classical counterpart. Building on these ideas, we also establish rigorous synergies between quantum experiments and classical machine learning. Shadow learning protocols use shadows to succinctly represent training data obtained from actual quantum experiments. A classical training stage then enables data-driven learning of genuine quantum phenomena. Finally, we develop new tools to ensure reliable execution on current quantum hardware, thus bridging the gap between theory and experiment.\n\nMy interdisciplinary skill set combines methods from modern computer science with quantum information and has already led to numerous high-impact contributions (e.g. 1 Nature Physics with more than 350 citations and 2 Science publications). These insights form the basis for this larger project, where we lay the foundation for scalable and practical quantum data processing and learning that can keep up and grow with future improvements in quantum technology.",

As for any degenerative disease, early diagnosis is crucial to improve patients\u2019 quality of life and reduce the mortality rate.

This can comprehensively visualize the lesions at the microscopic level in vivo, without taking any physical sample of the prostate. The resulting virtual microscope slide will allow urologists to explore and analyse various suspicious areas in the same procedure without the need to rely on the physical examination of the biopsy samples.\n\nPROCT is a paradigm shift in PC biopsy, that is poised to turn a subjective and operator-dependent procedure into a safer and more accurate diagnostic tool. This solution is obtained by merging the AI-based target identification with robotic pointing developed in the previous PoC project PROST with a micro-optical coherence tomography sensor capable to acquire images of the prostate through a needle at cellular-level resolution.\n\nThe PROCT prototype will be laboratory validated and benchmarked to assess its usability and real time capabilities.

Certifying that an AI satisfies certain requirements, such as fairness or safety standards, is pivotal for the regulation and use of this technology in many domains, especially those with high socio-economical stakes. Techniques that can provide formal guarantees on modern AI will have broad impacts on multiple areas described in the Horizon Europe strategic plan 2021-2024.  \n\nThe proposed framework goes beyond the state-of-the-art by adopting a probabilistic approach that satisfies three desiderata. First, it supports arbitrarily complex distributions, handling uncertainty over both non-deterministic systems and/or complex, multidimensional enviroments. Second, it unifies under the same formalism the verification of a multitude of ML models and properties of interest. Third, it enables the verification of ML models as part of a larger system and promises an easier integration into the existing probabilistic formal verification (PFV) tools. The approach is based on the notion of Weighted Model Integration, a recent formalism that enable probabilistic inference over arbitrary combination of logical theories and algebraic constraints.\n\nPaolo Morettin is one of the most prolific authors in the novel but vibrant field of WMI. Having both industrial experience in formal verification and a ML-oriented scientific background, he is the ideal candidate for pushing the boundaries of WMI-based probabilistic formal verification. As a MSCA postdoctoral fellow, Paolo Morettin will advance the state-of-the-art with both theoretical and technological contributions, with the ultimate goal of enabling and facilitating the integration of the proposed framework into the existing PFV tools. At the same time, he will develop a highly valuable multidisciplinary ML/FV background, enhancing his career perspectives.",

So far, however, robotic manipulation technology has struggled in managing the uncertainty and unstructuredness that characterize human environments.\nMachine learning is a natural approach -- the robot can adapt to a given scenario, even if it was not programmed to handle it beforehand. Indeed, Deep Reinforcement Learning (deep RL), which has recently led to AI breakthroughs in computer games, has been publicized as the learning-based approach to robotics. To date, however, deep RL studies focused on known and observable systems, where uncertainty was resolved by lengthy trial and error. Quickly learning to act in novel environments, as required for robotics, is not yet within our reach.\nThe crux of the matter is the tight coupling between perception and control under high uncertainty -- the robot must actively reduce uncertainty while also trying to solve the task; for complex and high-dimensional systems, we do not have a suitable algorithmic framework for this.\n\nIn this proposal, our overarching goal is to: \nDevelop the algorithmic framework of using deep learning in problems that tightly couple perception, planning, and control, for advancing robotic AI to reliably manipulate general objects in unstructured environments.\n\nTowards this end, we shall develop neural network representations of uncertainty, and algorithms that estimate uncertainty from data. We will develop theory and algorithms for decision making under uncertainty, bringing in a fresh perspective to the problem based on Bayesian reinforcement learning (Bayes-RL). These advances will allow us to study safety certificates for deep RL, and develop a general and practical methodology for learning-based robotic manipulation under uncertainty, validated on real robot experiments.

By learning to solve new and challenging tasks and exploiting their specific capabilities, they could become ubiquitous assistants to humans in an uncountable number of tasks. Current control strategies for robots are developed only for particular tasks and are not versatile. To ensure their functioning, it is necessary to have highly accurate physical models that precisely match all the essential aspects of the real world. REAL-RL follows a different path: a learning approach to robot control. The dominant direction in the field uses model-free reinforcement learning methods that need an incredible number of interactions with the world \u2013 often prohibitive for real robots. As a bypass, simulations are used but require detailed knowledge of all possible situations that the robot might encounter. These problems are circumvented in REAL-RL by proposing a model-based approach. Models of the interaction with the world are learned from experience and will be used to plan and adapt behavior on the fly. This approach promises to be much more data-efficient and allows to transfer of valuable experience between tasks. Fundamental challenges in model-learning, safety-aware exploration and planning, and higher-order reasoning are identified and presented here with concrete novel solution ideas, such as a causal inductive bias for deep dynamics models, risk-aware real-time general trajectory optimization, and differentiable discrete planning. Critical stepping stones, such as probabilistic models and fast trajectory planning, have just been developed by the community, and the applicant. By aiming at a generic learning method that can be used to control any robot \u2013 rigid or soft \u2013 with legs, arms, or other end-effectors for manipulation and locomotion tasks, and make them improve with experience, the proposal develops a solid basis for future robotic applications.",

Both projects focus on advancing reinforcement learning (RL) methods for robotic control, specifically targeting the challenges of manipulating and interacting with objects in unstructured environments. Here is a detailed analysis by criterion:\n\n1. Minor Objectives or Methods: Both projects aim to address the issues in robotic manipulation and control in unstructured environments, an area fraught with uncertainty. They share the goal of developing RL techniques that can help robots function autonomously despite such challenges.\n\n2. Overlapping Goals, Methodologies, or Innovations: The two proposals emphasize the importance of data efficiency and safety-aware exploration. While BAYES-RL focuses on Bayesian RL incorporating neural network representations of uncertainty, REAL-RL aims to use model-based approaches for more data-efficient learning. Despite slight methodological differences (Bayesian vs. model-based), both projects target the core problem of learning under uncertainty and applying it to real-world robotic tasks.\n\n3. Similarities in Scope, Methodology, and Innovation: The scope of both projects is to advance the field of robotic manipulation and control through innovative RL techniques. Though they approach the problem from slightly different angles (theoretical Bayesian methods vs. practical model-based learning), their overarching objectives and end goals align closely. They both aim to develop new algorithms and validate them through real-world robotic experiments.\n\n4. Alignment in Scope, Methodology, and Innovation with Efficiency Benefits: Combining these projects could indeed enhance resource efficiency. For instance, integrating Bayesian uncertainty handling with model-based learning could create a robust framework that leverages the strengths of both approaches. Shared resources such as data sets, simulation environments, and experimental platforms can be optimized, leading to improved research outputs.\n\n5. Near-Identical Scope, Methodology, and Innovation: The projects are nearly identical in their core goals: improving robotic manipulation through sophisticated RL methods. They target similar application domains, share a focus on overcoming uncertainty, and are poised to make significant contributions to robotic AI advancements. Practically, separating them would lead to duplication of efforts and inefficient use of resources, making a strong case for merging to capitalize on their combined strengths.\n\nGiven the high degree of overlap and potential for significant efficiency gains, merging BAYES-RL and REAL-RL is recommended.

However, the sheer scale and heterogeneity of future TNTN infrastructures is expected to create a unique set of challenges. To this end, 6G-TERRAIN adopts Integrated Communication and Sensing (ICAS) as a key enabler of TNTNs, allowing to perceive the complex and dynamic TNTNs through sensing the physical environment. Moreover, 6G-TERRAIN aims to propose, design, and validate a novel Native AI automation architecture and its associated enabling technologies and theoretical frameworks, aiming for an intent 6G System with seamlessly integrated multi-stakeholder & multi-technology (e.g., terrestrial and non-terrestrial) nodes. Natural Language intents are adopted, exploiting the breakthrough capabilities of emerging LLMs to automatically plan the optimal decompositions of intents into tasks and prioritise their downstream execution. Finally, 6G-TERRAIN will build a training network to conduct top-notch research towards the development and experimental evaluation of a gamut of techniques, methodological frameworks and tools that will break the barriers currently impeding the realisation of the 6G \"Network of Networks\" vision.",

Despite their success, DL methods do not obey most of the wisdoms of statistical learning theory, and the vast majority of the current DL techniques mainly stand as poorly understood black-box algorithms. \n\nEven though DL theory has been a very active research field in the past few years, there is a significant gap between the current theory and practice: (i) the current theory often becomes vacuous for models with large number of parameters (which is typical in DL), and (ii) it cannot capture the interaction between data, architecture, training algorithm and its hyper-parameters, which can have drastic effects on the overall performance. Due to this lack of theoretical understanding, designing new DL systems has been dominantly performed by ad-hoc, 'trial-and-error' approaches.\n\nThe main objective of this proposal is to develop a mathematically sound and practically relevant theory for DL, which will ultimately serve as the basis of a software library that provides practical tools for DL practitioners. In particular, (i) we will develop error bounds that closely reflect the true empirical performance, by explicitly incorporating the dynamics aspect of training, (ii) we will develop new model selection, training, and compression algorithms with reduced time/memory/storage complexity, by exploiting the developed theory.\n\nTo achieve the expected breakthroughs, we will develop a novel theoretical framework, which will enable tight analysis of learning algorithms in the lens of dynamical systems theory. The outcomes will help relieve DL from being a black-box system and avoid the heuristic design process. We will produce comprehensive open-source software tools adapted to all popular DL libraries, and test the developed algorithms on a wide range of real applications arising in computer vision, audio/music/natural language processing.",

In my junior research group, I have developed end-to-end DL methods to predict molecular biomarkers and clinical outcomes directly from histopathology slides. Because histopathology slides are ubiquitously available for any patient with a solid tumor, DL is a broad tool for translational studies, enabling researchers to extract molecular information and make predictions about clinical outcome.\nHowever, the potential of DL in cancer research is fundamentally limited because it is purely descriptive and, in many cases, a black-box system. Also, DL is currently disjoint from the vast amount of biological mechanistic knowledge in cancer research, and from the world of experimentation. In NADIR, I will close this gap. My hypothesis is that DL models can not only make predictions but can be used to verify\nexisting biological knowledge and to make new mechanistic discoveries. The main tools that allow me to address this are concept explainability and counterfactual virtual experimentation. For both, there exists a nonmedical proof of concept, but no systematic biomedical application yet. I approach this problem as a biomedical cancer researcher with training in programming, medical image analysis, and biomedical engineering. As such, I will develop DL systems that can extract biological concepts, can elucidate biological mechanisms, and can be used to create, and answer, mechanistic hypotheses. NADIR\u2019s tools will be synergistic with and can be used together with other biological high-throughput experimentation pipelines such as transgenic animal experiments or tumor organoid cultures. The main use case of NADIR is focused on tumor-immune interaction in colorectal and gastric cancer, and through the educational and outreach program in NADIR, it will be made available as a general tool for cancer researchers in biomedicine.",

These devices,\nhowever, still lack intuitive control approaches imposing additional cognitive load on their users. A future\nwearable robot that can help us to walk, run, jump, dance, and restore independence in people with neuromuscular\nimpairments, requires the key ingredient to achieve the symbiotic connection between the user and the robot. In the\nclassical control strategy for wearable robots, inertial measurement units (IMUs) are often exploited to detect\nuser\u2019s motion intention. Although the latter are valuable wearable tools, their reliability and accuracy are often\ndebated, due to their drift and poor battery life (being powered), raising challenges for researchers and engineers to\nimprove their stability over time. The SCOUT project aims to break this technological bottleneck by developing a\nnovel wearable artificial sensor system based on passive magnetic markers to detect human motion.\nInspired by the natural human sensorimotor system, and exploiting recent advances in magnets localization, a soft\nmagnetic exoskin will be designed to transduce joints motion of the user into decipherable magnetic fields. These\nwill be decoded by a central interpreting unit to have a real-time, reliable, and robust measure of human kinematics\nwithout the need of time-consuming parameter tuning and calibrations. Besides the intended benefit for current\nwearable robots, this project could develop a novel human-machine interface with wide potential for a diverse\nrange of applications, such as human motion analysis, ergonomics, virtual reality, and robotic teleoperation.",

Soft lower extremity exoskeletons (\"soft wearable robotics\" (SWRs)) are one of the most challenging research topics, and require multidisciplinary approaches involving diverse fields such as neuroscience, biomechanics, robot control, ergonomics and other fields.\nSWAG aims to explore a fundamentally new approach to engineering soft structures that omit fully rigid materials for inflatable ones made from high-strength fabrics and films when manufacturing human-assistive exoskeletal devices that target strain-prone segments of the human body (i.e. lower body and core). Such soft wearable adaptive garments with actuation capabilities offer higher variable stiffness and force-to-weight ratios compared to other existing methods, and simultaneously entirely conform to each joint\u2019s intricate kinematics. Because of this, new design approaches can be used as building blocks to realise complete assistance for multi-degree-of-freedom joints, such as the ankle or hip, by adapting flexible and conforming motions achieved by continuum robot designs. \nSWAG\u2019s advances will be demonstrated in 4 different application scenarios. The project brings together 13 partners from 5 EU countries and the UK. The partners consist of an interdisciplinary combination of leading academics with very strong track records in their respective fields.

The current field is driven by a high adoption of soft grippers that ensure safe operation for collaborative robots in manufacturing and delicate manipulation in agrifood and warehousing. However, these expensive and mostly non-recyclable soft robots have limited lifetimes due to their vulnerability to damage. In symbiosis, VUB-research groups FYSC and Brubotics have been building soft robots out of self-healing materials that fully recover functional material properties and resulting performances after healing incurred damage. This extends the robots service lifetime and raises their reliability and sustainability, which in combination with their inherent recyclability contributes to economic benefits and the EU Green Deal. In SHINTO, technological breakthroughs will mature beyond lab demonstrators over pilot scale towards commercial viability through synergistic advances in (patented) self-healing polymers, manufacturing, application validation and business development. The team combines profound knowledge of materials and robotics scientists with business experts to establish a new deep tech company, marketing next generation self-healing grippers as semi-finished goods. The beach-head strategy targets existing soft robotics markets based on confirmed product-market fits. Existing feedback loops with key industrial partners, field tests and life cycle assessment allow to cocreate the required quality and TRL for business transition, while limiting business risk to a niche market. Parallel, continuous market analysis enables updating/expanding requirements and extending to broader (non-)robotic markets. The soft robotics market is expected to grow at 40%/y to $6.3B by 2027, while market fits beyond this niche are identified, e.g. the tire market at $174B in 2028.",

Enzymes are the most efficient, specific, and selective catalysts known. Green chemistry has emerged as a new area focusing on use of environmentally friendly, non-hazardous and efficient solvents and catalysts in the synthesis of new products. Enzymes are non-toxic, and capable of operating under mild biological conditions, which makes them green catalysts offering an attractive alternative to traditional catalysis. However, their application in industry is rather limited as most industrial processes lack a natural enzyme. The solution is the routine design of enzymes, but this task has not yet been achieved due to several limitations, such as the high complexity of enzyme catalysis, the lack of accurate computational approaches for designing and estimating the catalytic potential of the new variants, and the inability to identify potential mutation sites far away from the active site of the enzyme. GREENZYME provides a new protocol able to capture this high complexity and design new enzymes capable of predicting active site and distal mutations, thus achieving high levels of activity (as it would occur in nature). This is achieved by integrating current Shortest Path Map-Ancestral Sequence Reconstruction (SPM-ASR)-based computational protocol developed in previous projects such as the ERC-StG NetMoDEzyme with deep learning techniques. Thanks to a well-thought-out exploitation and communication strategy, will make possible the premise of routine enzyme design.

Nature has evolved extremely active catalysts (enzymes) for the conversion of small molecules relevant to energy (H2, CO2, N2). The scalability of these enzymes offers distinct advantages over the rare, precious metals that are currently used in energy conversion. Unfortunately, the enzymes are unable to tolerate the extreme conditions of operating fuel cells or electrolyzers. Directed evolution is a powerful approach for improving enzymes, but is mostly restricted to natural amino acids and biological conditions, with limited compatibility for evolving enzymes toward enhanced resistance in abiotic systems. Here, I aim to establish directed evolution in fully abiotic systems, using artificial amino acids to make artificial enzymes that are stable even in extreme conditions. Towards this, I will establish new electrochemical peptide synthesis platforms to enable the generation of enzyme-length peptides using both natural and artificial amino acids. Extended libraries of artificial enzyme variants will be produced and screened directly on electrode microarrays. Top enzyme candidates for the conversion of H2 will be selected using fuel cell/electrolyzer conditions as the evolutionary criteria. By the end, I will have a new procedure for synthesizing libraries of full-length artificial proteins, enabling the creation of thousands of enzyme variants using artificial building blocks. The generation of high-quality datasets will be transformative to drive future machine learning-based evolution steps for both full size enzymes and small-molecule catalysts with applications beyond H2 evolution.

NDR enables a two-terminal device to display self-oscillations due to applied electrical spikes. The spiking electrical currents could be used to govern the behaviour of these oscillations and emulating the leaky, integrate, and fire behaviour of biological neurons.

However, implementing such algorithms in low-power devices remains a challenge due to the energy inefficiency that comes from separating logic and memory in current electronic systems. For the past 10 years, research groups have been developing alternative electronic components and systems, such as brain inspired computing architectures and novel resistive memory technologies to address this design bottleneck. The critical feature for these new technologies to perform at their best is a very high-density, reliable, non-volatile memory with infinite endurance. This ideal memory does not exist today, and it is unlikely it will ever exist. This project takes inspiration from the insect\u2019s nervous system. The general aim of DIVERSE is to enable learning from a very limited volume of noisy data based on imperfect, limited density, low endurance, resistive memories. Unlike digital systems, insects are not very good at performing precise calculations, but they excel at making extremely energy-efficient real time decisions by combining sensory data recorded in noisy environments. I thus propose to take inspiration from the well-studied cricket\u2019s nervous system and to use my experience and skills in resistive memories to develop a new technology that expresses robust cognitive behaviour while interacting with the environment. This cross-disciplinary work will lead to the fabrication of an innovative hardware/software platform with extremely high power efficiency and robust cognitive computing capabilities.

COSPIN overcomes this connectivity constraint by using the eigen-excitations of the magnetic system - the spin waves - to connect state-of-the-art artificial neurons based on spintronic auto-oscillators.  COSPIN\u2019S main goal is to create and experimentally validate innovative physical building blocks for a novel nano-scaled, all-spintronic network structure which incorporates all necessary properties for neuromorphic computing including high nonlinearity, interconnectivity and reprogrammability.  By design, COSPIN works at the boundary between oscillator-based computing and wave-based computing. It uses interference, frequency-multiplexing, and time-modulation techniques as well as spin-wave amplification to significantly increase the connectivity between neurons. Reprogramming of the network is implemented by a direct physical link to magnetic memory solutions as well as by reconfiguring spin-wave circuits. By using coherent wave interference and nonlinear wave interaction, COSPIN paves the way for novel coupling phenomena for complex artificial neural networks far beyond the state-of-the-art of current hardware realizations. Using cutting-edge micromagnetic simulations enhanced by inverse design methods, the artificial networks will be designed and tested prior to their nano-fabrication.

This paradigm faces serious flaws in many real-world cases. In particular, centralized learning risks exposing user privacy, makes inefficient use of communication resources, creates data processing bottlenecks, and may lead to concentration of economic and political power. It thus appears most timely to develop the theory and practice of a new form of machine learning that targets heterogeneous, massively decentralized networks, involving self-interested agents who expect to receive value (or rewards, incentive) for their participation in data exchanges.\n\nOCEAN will develop statistical and algorithmic foundations for systems involving multiple incentive-driven learning and decision-making agents, including uncertainty quantification at the agent's level. OCEAN will study the interaction of learning with market constraints (scarcity, fairness), connecting adaptive microeconomics and market-aware machine learning.\n\nOCEAN builds on a decade of joint advances in stochastic optimization, probabilistic machine learning, statistical inference, Bayesian assessment of uncertainty, computation, game theory, and information science, with PIs having complementary and internationally recognized skills in these domains. OCEAN will shed new light on the value and handling of data in a competitive, potentially antagonistic multi-agent environment, and develop new theories and methods to address these pressing challenges. OCEAN requires a fundamental departure from standard approaches and leads to major scientific interdisciplinary endeavors that will transform statistical learning in the long term while opening up exciting and novel areas of research.",

            "objective": "Recent years have witnessed tremendous progress in the field of Machine Learning (ML). Learning algorithms are applied in an ever-increasing variety of contexts, ranging from engineering challenges such as self-driving cars all the way to societal contexts involving private data. These developments pose important challenges (i) Many of the recent breakthroughs demonstrate phenomena that lack explanations, and sometimes even contradict conventional wisdom. One main reason for this is because classical ML theory adopts a worst-case perspective which is too pessimistic to explain practical ML: in reality data is rarely worst-case, and experiments indicate that often much less data is needed than predicted by traditional theory. (ii) The increase in ML applications that involve private and sensitive data highlights the need for algorithms that handle the data responsibly. While this need has been addressed by the field of Differential Privacy (DP), the cost of privacy remains poorly understood: How much more data does private learning require, compared to learning without privacy constraints? Inspired by these challenges, our guiding question is:  How much data is needed for learning? Towards answering this question we aim to develop a theory of generalization which complements the traditional theory and is better fit to model real-world learning tasks. We will base it on distribution-, data-, and algorithm-dependent perspectives. These complement the  distribution-free worst-case perspective of the classical theory, and are suitable for exploiting specific properties of a given learning task. We will use this theory to study various settings, including supervised, semisupervised, interactive, and private learning. We believe that this research will advance the field in terms of efficiency, reliability, and applicability. Furthermore, our work combines ideas from various areas in computer science and mathematics; we thus expect further impact outside our field.",

Storage of hydrogen as a gas typically requires high-pressure tanks (up to 700 bar tank pressure); storage of hydrogen as a liquid requires cryogenic temperatures because the boiling point of hydrogen at one atmosphere pressure is -253C. Therefore, for several applications, ammonia rises as a rather prominent vector if it can be produced efficiently. The production is traditionally bound by the constraints of thermodynamics, which require high synthesis pressures, as well as temperatures. Thus, NH3 is produced centralised/large-scaled. \nHySTrAm builds on developing physical H2 storage materials, enabling short term storage (buffering renewables dynamics), as well as the 3 structural corner stones of flexible low pressure NH3: decreased Ru content catalysts, high temperature NH3 sorbents and induction-heated support granting (optimal) responsiveness.

The successful completion of these objectives will provide unique information for experimental synthesis of intermetallic compounds with high catalytic activity for the HER and ORR and could, therefore, open a new avenue for a feasible and efficient hydrogen economy. Moreover, the strategies and tools developed in this project can be applied later to many other catalytic processes of large industrial and/or environmental interest. To achieve these goals, the project HighHydrogenML involves multidisciplinary expertise in solid state physics, materials science, machine learning, and chemistry that will be coupled in a seamless framework to exploit the high predictive power of ab initio calculations in conjunction with the efficiency of ML models.  Therefore, this project brings together a researcher with expertise in atomistic and materials modelling within a broad range of different computational chemistry methods and artificial intelligence techniques, a world-recognized supervisor in the area of multiscale modelling of materials, and a research institute with a record of excellence, technology transfer, and top-level training in Materials Science and Engineering.",

HySTrAm is centered on ammonia synthesis from hydrogen, using innovative catalysts and sorbents for efficient NH3 production and storage. HighHydrogenML, on the other hand, focuses on high-throughput discovery of intermetallic catalysts for HER and ORR through elastic strain engineering and computational modeling, without addressing ammonia synthesis. Given these distinctions, both projects maintain enough uniqueness in scope and specific aims to justify proceeding independently. However, merging these projects may bring moderate benefits in resource sharing, particularly in the areas where ML techniques and hydrogen storage materials intersect.",

This is my vision of future exoskeletons being just like everyday clothing, light, soft, and powerful enough to fully support the wearer.\nThe loss of the ability to walk is devastating for many suffering from stroke, spinal cord injury, and alike. An ergonomic, light-weight exoskeleton can surely help these patients to walk again autonomously. This is challenging due to large gaps between conventional rigid body dynamic-based walking control and soft structures because such an exoskeleton has to integrate high-performance soft mechatronics, to perform walking to an unprecedented extent. I am uniquely qualified to achieve this due to my extensive experience in the fields of robotics and neuroengineering, as well as my leading role in the engineering of world-leading high-performance humanoid robots which incorporate control, modelling, and experimental evaluation.\nSTROLL will develop a soft wearable robotic exoskeleton to restore the walking capability of patients with lower-body paralysis. The soft wearable exoskeleton that I propose to develop will combine ground-breaking innovations in advanced high-performance textile-based actuators, lower-body tactile sensors, and advanced locomotion control. STROLL will investigate new control strategies and methods for tactile-based control for balancing and walking.\nAs its ultimate goal, STROLL will take on the ambition to enable a lower-limb paralysed person to take a stroll in the park with an autonomous soft textile exoskeleton.\nDespite the methodological difficulties and the uncertainty of the results, the project is more than worth pursuing, as the pay-off is highly significant to benefit the lives of millions of patients suffering from lower-limbs disorders.",

In the past years, enormous efforts have been made to unravel their mathematical properties, leading to fundamental insights and mathematical guarantees on when and why deep learning works well. ANNs are inspired by biological neural networks (BNNs) but differ in many respects: ANNs represent functions while BNNs represent stochastic processes, and the gradient-based deep learning applied for ANNs is very different from the local updating of BNNs. \nBNNs are superior to ANNs in the sense that the brain learns faster and generalizes better. Despite the urgency for answers and the rich and interesting mathematical structures that BNNs create, scarcely any theoretical attempts have been made to understand learning in the brain. The stochastic process structure of BNNs and the need to understand the statistical convergence behavior call for a mathematical statistics approach. This project proposes the development of advanced mathematical tools in nonparametric and high- dimensional statistics to analyze learning in BNNs as a statistical method. The starting point is a novel interpretation of the local updating of BNN parameters as a specific and non-standard, derivative-free optimization method. Whereas derivative-free optimization is thought to be slow, our conjecture is that it leads to favorable statistical properties in the setting underlying BNNs. \nIf the research is successful, it has the potential to open a new research area in mathematical statistics and provide insights into how the brain learns. It could also lead to recommendations on how to make AI more efficient with less training data and how to train neuromorphic computer chips mimicking BNNs.",

ANNs are inspired by the nervous system and biological behavior, creating a layered interconnection system of artificial neurons that collaborate to process input data and generate output. ANNs differ from other AI models in having the ability to learn automatically (machine learning). This technology has enormous current impact and potential for future applications, just to mention a few ones: autonomous vehicles, renewable energy, economy and financial predictions, computer visions, and disruptive medicine and health care services. In the last decade, ANNs have become a very popular topic, but the technology itself has been around for many decades with several problems yet to be solved. For example, current computer systems are highly inadequate in terms of data processing, storage and transmission. Aspects related to energy consumption are also an unsolved problem, where the rational use of energy and natural resources is a fundamental objective of global sustainability. NEMERFEC aims to realize novel ANNs through the development of hardware based on memristive and ferroelectric material systems. Such thin films of binary and complex oxides are to be deposited by physical ablation methods, such as PLD and sputtering, with a high degree of control during deposition. Advanced characterization techniques, microfabrication and nanofabrication of devices will be performed at the clean room facilities of the Aragon Nanoscience and Materials Institute (INMA-CSIC) to obtain ANNs at nanometric scales and with an ultra-fast response time. The final ANNs will be implemented in the analysis of thermal images in hyperthermia processes with magnetic nanoparticles at the Nano Scale Biomagnetics company during the non-academic placement period.

On the other hand, QTEngine focuses on software solutions, developing a quantum tensor engine to facilitate the implementation of specialized algorithms that enhance the performance of current and near-term quantum devices. Given these distinctions, the projects offer complementary rather than redundant contributions to the field. Merging them may provide some benefits through resource efficiency and a more unified approach but would also acknowledge their unique innovations and separate developmental paths. Therefore, while there may be some minor efficiencies to gain from a merger, the projects' differences suggest they can continue to proceed independently to maximize their specific areas of innovation.",

            "objective": "Recent years have witnessed tremendous progress in the field of Machine Learning (ML). Learning algorithms are applied in an ever-increasing variety of contexts, ranging from engineering challenges such as self-driving cars all the way to societal contexts involving private data. These developments pose important challenges (i) Many of the recent breakthroughs demonstrate phenomena that lack explanations, and sometimes even contradict conventional wisdom. One main reason for this is because classical ML theory adopts a worst-case perspective which is too pessimistic to explain practical ML: in reality data is rarely worst-case, and experiments indicate that often much less data is needed than predicted by traditional theory. (ii) The increase in ML applications that involve private and sensitive data highlights the need for algorithms that handle the data responsibly. While this need has been addressed by the field of Differential Privacy (DP), the cost of privacy remains poorly understood: How much more data does private learning require, compared to learning without privacy constraints? Inspired by these challenges, our guiding question is:  How much data is needed for learning? Towards answering this question we aim to develop a theory of generalization which complements the traditional theory and is better fit to model real-world learning tasks. We will base it on distribution-, data-, and algorithm-dependent perspectives. These complement the  distribution-free worst-case perspective of the classical theory, and are suitable for exploiting specific properties of a given learning task. We will use this theory to study various settings, including supervised, semisupervised, interactive, and private learning. We believe that this research will advance the field in terms of efficiency, reliability, and applicability. Furthermore, our work combines ideas from various areas in computer science and mathematics; we thus expect further impact outside our field.",

However, as machine learning models grow in capacity, they become increasingly \u2018black box\u2019, and it becomes harder for humans to reason about the patterns discovered by the machine. A root cause of this difficulty is that most machine learning models can express the same pattern in infinitely many, equally good, ways within their internal representations of the world. This is known as an identifiability problem.\n\nToday we lack a general solution to identifiability problems, and either give up on understanding the patterns discovered by the machine or reduce model complexity to lessen the problem. The latter also reduces the fidelity and applicability of the model. NoKnow rephrase the question of identifiability to be concerned with tasks solved by the representation rather than the representation itself. Using tools from differential geometry and Bayesian inference, we develop the theoretical tools to ensure that tasks solved in the representation have an identifiable outcome even if the representations themselves are not identifiable.\n\nTo turn theory into practice, we develop state-of-the-art algorithms for assessing the uncertainty of learned representations in order to indirectly estimate the topology of the representation manifold. We further develop novel, high-fidelity predictive models that have identifiable outcomes when trained on learned representations.\n\nNoKnow provides the fundamental tools needed to engage with learned representations to guarantee identifiable outcomes. This, in turn, increase trust in findings as they are not dependent on arbitrariness in learned representations.

            "objective": "Speckle patterns are distinct features of disordered materials. While often regarded as mere noise, the intricate and responsive speckle patterns to minor fluctuations in external factors render them an ideal candidate for applications in hyperspectral imaging and sensing. The MetaSpectrometer harnesses the high information capacity of the speckle pattern of resonant disordered metasurfaces for compact, machine learning-assisted, non-invasive, and efficient near-infrared spectroscopy. An ultra-compact footprint, portability, cost-efficiency, minimal losses, machine-learning assisted recognition, angle-insensitivity, suppressed specular scatterance, significant memory effect, and ability to accommodate low coherence fields are the main features that cannot be currently obtained with any technology proposed so far and would represent a huge step forward in the state of the art. MetaSpectrometer brings together the complementary expertise of the postdoctoral researcher (PR) in metasurface engineering; the incoming host (CNRS-C2N, France) in silicon photonics, optoelectronics and nanofabrication; the associated the outgoing host (MIT, USA) in spectroscopy and machine learning, the secondment host (Rice, USA) in lensless imaging and the industrial partner (ZEISS, Germany) in spectroscopy and market analysis. The project allows PR to acquire expertise in silicon photonics technology's design, fabrication, characterization, and commercialization while giving back his expertise in metasurface design. The developed NIR spectrometers will find direct potential applications in wearable health monitoring systems, food screening, agriculture, and environmental screening that a remarkable global market size. The distribution of the work packages with distinct and clearly defined milestones and deliverables makes sure that the progress of the project will be monitored and matched with the work plan.",

            "objective": "In recent years, the use of machine learning (ML) for the study of physics has experienced a strong boost. However, most of the machines used are black boxes, and the causal relation between inputs and outputs is often impossible to extract. Nonetheless, a critical aspect when dealing with physical systems is not only to make correct predictions, but to understand the physical laws which underlie these assessments. Recently, an increasing number of works aim at developing interpretable ML methods, from which such hidden laws can be extracted. However, their application to physics has been often limited to supervised and unsupervised learning approaches.\nThe aim of this project is: 1) construct an interpretable reinforcement learning method; 2) extract hidden rules and features in timely and paramount problems in physics. The method combines three well-established concepts of ML: projective simulation, graph neural networks (GNN) and hidden variable disentanglement. PS provides interpretable RL agents that can be trained for a variety of tasks, from the construction of quantum experiments, via skill acquisition in robotics, to the modelling of honeybee colonies. By enhancing their learning power and interpretability with GNNs and variable disentanglement, we will extract the hidden features of the systems the RL agents have interacted with and ultimately, the physical laws governing them. In particular, we will tackle problems in the field of condensed matter, where particles diffuse either passively or actively, to reach a target state. Moreover, we will consider ensembles of RL agents, so as to analyze not only the physical properties of the systems, but also their interactions and communication dynamics in the quest of a common target.\nThe originality of the proposal is directly related to: 1) the methods that will be developed; 2) the systems of study; 3) most importantly, the information we will access and discover with the interpretable RL agents.",

Certifying that an AI satisfies certain requirements, such as fairness or safety standards, is pivotal for the regulation and use of this technology in many domains, especially those with high socio-economical stakes. Techniques that can provide formal guarantees on modern AI will have broad impacts on multiple areas described in the Horizon Europe strategic plan 2021-2024.  \n\nThe proposed framework goes beyond the state-of-the-art by adopting a probabilistic approach that satisfies three desiderata. First, it supports arbitrarily complex distributions, handling uncertainty over both non-deterministic systems and/or complex, multidimensional enviroments. Second, it unifies under the same formalism the verification of a multitude of ML models and properties of interest. Third, it enables the verification of ML models as part of a larger system and promises an easier integration into the existing probabilistic formal verification (PFV) tools. The approach is based on the notion of Weighted Model Integration, a recent formalism that enable probabilistic inference over arbitrary combination of logical theories and algebraic constraints.\n\nPaolo Morettin is one of the most prolific authors in the novel but vibrant field of WMI. Having both industrial experience in formal verification and a ML-oriented scientific background, he is the ideal candidate for pushing the boundaries of WMI-based probabilistic formal verification. As a MSCA postdoctoral fellow, Paolo Morettin will advance the state-of-the-art with both theoretical and technological contributions, with the ultimate goal of enabling and facilitating the integration of the proposed framework into the existing PFV tools. At the same time, he will develop a highly valuable multidisciplinary ML/FV background, enhancing his career perspectives.",

Similarly we don\u2019t know how to test if a system is compliant with these principles and repair it in case it is not.\nAEQUITAS proposes the design of a controlled experimentation environment for developers and users to create controlled experiments for\n- assessing the bias in AI systems, e.g., identifying potential causes of bias in data, algorithms, and interpretation of results,\n- providing, when possible, effective methods and engineering guidelines to repair, remove, and mitigate bias,\n- provide fairness-by-design guidelines, methodologies, and software engineering techniques to design new bias-free systems\nThe experimentation environment generates synthetic data sets with different features influencing fairness for a test in laboratories. Real use cases in health care, human resources and social disadvantaged group challenges further test the experimentation platform showcasing the effectiveness of the solution proposed.

Apart from the pure scientific curiosity it stimulates, I believe that this lack of understanding poses a significant obstacle to widening the applicability of ML to critical applications, like in healthcare or autonomous driving, where the cost of error is disastrous.  The broad goal of this project is to tackle the generalization mystery in the context of both statistical learning and reinforcement learning, focusing on optimization algorithms being the de facto contemporary standard in training learning models.  Our methodology points out to inherent shortcomings of widely accepted viewpoints with regard to generalization of optimization-based learning algorithms, and takes a crucially different approach that targets the optimization algorithm itself; building bottom-up from fundamental and tractable optimization models, we identify intrinsic properties and develop algorithmic methodologies that enable optimization to effectively generalize in modern statistical- and reinforcement-learning scenarios.

            "objective": "Despite the undeniable success of machine learning in addressing a wide variety of technological and scientific challenges, the current trend of training predictive models with an evergrowing number of parameters from an evergrowing amount of data is not sustainable. These huge models, often engineered by large corporations benefiting from huge computational resources, typically require learning a billion or more of parameters. They have proven to be very effective in solving prediction tasks in computer vision, natural language processing, and computational biology, for example, but they mostly remain black boxes that are hard to interpret, computationally demanding, and not robust to small data perturbations.\nWith a strong emphasis on visual modeling, the grand challenge of APHELEIA is to develop a new generation of machine learning models that are more robust, interpretable, and efficient, and do not require massive amounts of data to produce accurate predictions. To achieve this objective, we will foster new interactions between classical signal processing, statistics, optimization, and modern deep learning. Our goal is to reduce the need for massive data by enabling scientists and engineers to design trainable machine learning models that directly encode a priori knowledge of the task semantics and data formation process, while automatically prefering simple and stable solutions over complex ones. These models will be built on solid theoretical foundations with convergence and robustness guarantees, which are important to make real-life trustworthy predictions in the wild. We will implement these ideas in an open-source software toolbox readily applicable to visual recognition and inverse imaging problems, which will also handle other modalities. This will stimulate interdisciplinary collaborations, with the potential to be a game changer in the way scientists and engineers design machine learning problems.",

They have potentially a tremendous long-term impact in areas such as quantum-many body physics and material science, and further afield in machine learning. The quantum many-body problems studied by condensed matter physicists are perhaps the most likely to yield early demonstrations of this potential. However, current and near-term intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices are limited in the number of operations that they can carry out before their performance is degraded by interactions with the environment. To take advantage of these platforms and to outperform classical computers, highly efficient and specialized quantum algorithms are required. The implementation and benchmarking of these basic algorithms on different quantum computing platforms is challenging and requires a detailed knowledge of the underlying physics. Our approach is to produce a ready-to-use, highly innovative software package based upon quantum tensor networks. The Quantum Tensor Engine (QTEngine) will provide a unifying framework for both quantum and classical algorithms. The QTEngine will serve as an engine to drive fast and easy implementation of quantum simulation, quantum machine learning, and optimization algorithms.

IoT leads to a high automation potential with which we improve the life of billions of people and compensate for societal problems such as a growingly old population, missing high-skilled labour across Europe or the efficiency limits in current production capabilities. IoT5.0, an Artificial Intelligence (AI) -assisted Internet of Things, could even more benefit society, as the devices could even learn how to provide more value. But the ubiquitous connectivity comes at a cost. Security levels have to rise tremendously to ensure a network stays secure and safe for humans. This additional effort often is a burden for small and medium sized enterprises as the complexity and security demands of such systems rise faster than available resources. This is especially dangerous as a single corrupted, malicious device can result in the exploitation of the entire network of connected devices by an attacker. Consequently, RESILIENT TRUST focuses on end-to-end security of IoT processing chains with a focus on strong exploitation for SMEs. This vision will be realized by developing specialized hardware to establish TRUST in-between a network and a wall of RESILIENCE even against new attack methods such as post quantum attacks and AI based attacks. The architecture of the secure processing chain will be carefully built after threat modelling, asset identification, risk analysis, security objectives and requirements definition. Consequently, RESILIENT TRUST will address and significantly mitigate these major risks to enable IoT5.0. That way this project will be a driver for sustainable development and the generation of convenience and wealth.

Massive quantities of data produced by IoT devices revolutionize the way such ecosystems operate via the exploitation of AI models/services. This has led to the emergence of the so-called Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) systems. In general, designing techniques to promote robustness, efficiency and continual operation of AIoT systems requires realistic and trustworthy data at scale. However, such data is not always easy to obtain due to the cost of smart space construction, the inconvenience of long-term device tracking, the sensor/knowledge data gaps in diverse scenarios of a smart space, and the restrictions imposed on sensitive data sharing. Furthermore, an efficient AIoT system operation requires trustworthy AI services, as well as novel approaches for speeding up their inference across the IoT-Edge/Cloud continuum. PANDORA aims to devise and implement a comprehensive framework enabling the delivery of trustworthy datasets of smart space ecosystems, as well as the deployment and green operation of AIoT systems in such spaces. PANDORA spans two phases: (1) prior to AIoT system deployment; (2) post AIoT system deployment and operation. Phase 1 proposes and combines a series of novel techniques such as synthetic data generation, quantification of uncertainties, and data summarization for the delivery of trustworthy datasets, as well as explainable AI and domain-informed model training/testing in smart space ecosystems. Phase 2 defines novel AIaaS and CaaS techniques for the robust, explainable, green and continual operation of AIoT systems deployed in such spaces.

At the moment, different sensors have to be implemented in the electronic skin matrix for each stimulus. As a result, the existing technologies are complex, expensive, sometimes based on toxic materials or are not able to demonstrate multi-stimuli responsiveness and high resolution.  With Smart Skin we will create a prototype for artificial skin that will surpass others already existing on the market by responding at the same time to three stimuli: temperature, force and humidity with high spatial resolution and better mimicking with such integrated response the sensitivity of the human skin.   The sensing unit is done by a combination of two materials to reduce the required number of active sensing layers, while still being capable of multi-stimuli responsiveness. A smart material, responsive to humidity and temperature, is integrated as core in a piezoresponsive shell. Nano-structuration of such sensing unit in core-shell site-specific geometrical layouts allows to create a sensing network with spatial resolution down to 1mm (human skin\u2019s resolution ) and lower. This unique architecture is achieved thanks to the use of state-of-the-art fabrication techniques with high control over material properties, as well as, material uniformity. The advantage of using dry, vapor-based, processing is that it is possible to cumulate features from precursors with different solubilities and with engineered composition gradients, which are difficult to obtain by conventional chemical synthesis.   Robotics and smart prosthetics would greatly benefit from a more integrated and precise sensoring information. Enabling these new features would make robots used in households, for example, aware of dangerous increases in temperature and in general more human friendly because they would be more responsive.",

The envisioned smart skins will operate at microwave frequencies, and the same device will also allow far-field communication. The key technology enabling these functionalities is that of metasurfaces, i.e. structured surfaces that have unusual properties at some frequencies. In this case, they convey and manipulate surface waves, which also can be turned into radiating leaky waves for far-field communications. The research follows a holistic and multidisciplinary concept targeting thin smart skins: the FITNESS project encompasses the synthesis of new low-loss flexible microwave substrates, research on the embedded electronics, the analysis and design of metasurfaces on curved structures and data analysis. The first demonstrator will be realized in the field of robotics, while later applications are envisioned in the medical area. Therefore, FITNESS will integrate ultra-low power operation from the beginning. The devices will essentially work through the measurement of the transmittance between a limited number of ports (sparse electronics), through surface waves following the shape of the smart skin which is wrapped around the robot or the body. The workpackages follow the main challenges toward the new technology: sparse, curved, integrated and flexible metasurfaces. One of the main societal outputs will consist of a more harmonious cooperation between robots and humans through the constant probing of their respective near-field environments.\nThis ambitious 48-months 3.6 MEuros action gathers complementary key European experts from 4 EU countries, covering electromagnetics, electronics, materials, robotics, thermal aspects, but also the necessary skills for appropriate management, communication and exploitation: 3 universities (5 research teams), 2 SMEs and 2 research centers.",

It is expected that the emerging sustainable AI methods can be efficiently deployed in the edge-cloud continuum on different hardware platforms and computing infrastructure depending on the real-world task scenarios and constraints including the limited energy budget. In response to this growing demand and emerging trends we propose to adopt a brain-like approach to AI system design due to its promising potential for functional flexibility, hardware friendliness as well as energy efficiency among others. To this end, EXTRA-BRAIN is aimed at developing a new generation of AI solutions based on brain-like neural networks that enable us to overcome key limitations of the current state-of-the-art methods, exemplified by deep learning, such as limited cross-task generalisation and extrapolation to novel domains (bounded reliability), excessive dependence on costly annotated data as well as extensive training and validation processes with heavy demand for compute resources at high energy cost, to name a few. The core brain-like neural network design in our approach derives from the accumulated computational neuroscience insights into the brain's working principles of information processing, key learning schemes and neuroanatomical structures that underlie the brain's perceptual/cognitive phenomena and its functional flexibility. Furthermore, these novel models are supported by data optimisation pipelines, which improve data quality, security and reduce the costs of assembling suitable training data, and an explainability framework to empower the human user. The proposed EXTRA-BRAIN framework will be examined in a diverse set of use cases with different hardware demands in the edge-cloud continuum.",

Motivated by this, TALON aims at sculpturing the road towards the next Industrial revolution by developing a fully-automated AI architecture capable of bringing intelligence near the edge in a flexible, adaptable,  explainable, energy and data efficient manner.

Over the recent years, we have begun to appreciate how closely astrocytes support the development and function of synapses, the proposed substrate of memory. One emerging function of astrocytes is their direct involvement in learning and long-term memory. Indeed, astrocytic activity is affected in major brain disorders that affect memory, such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \nThe overarching aim of this fellowship is to study how astrocyte-neuron coordinated activity relates to learning and memory. \nI propose that astrocyte-neuron activity dynamics are shaped by learning over days to support memory formation.\nTo test this hypothesis, I will use state-of-the-art microscopy and genetically encoded fluorescent proteins, both available in the host laboratory, to record the activity of large numbers of neurons and astrocytes while mice are trained in a perceptual learning task over days. In this way, I will be able to see how neurons and astrocytes change their activity in response to learning. I will then manipulate the activity of astrocytes using clever genetic tools and light, while the mice are being trained, and monitor the effects of this manipulation on the activity of neurons and memory performance. This step will allow me to establish causal links between astrocyte activity and memory. Finally, I will use modern statistical learning techniques to explore the contribution of astrocytes and astrocyte-neuron interactions to the computational capacity of the brain. \nThis proposal capitalizes on my strong expertise in rodent behaviour and data analysis, my knowledge and strong interest on how experience shapes brain activity, and the established microscopy and genetic techniques in the host laboratory. Overall, this project will allow me to acquire new skills and knowledge in microscopy and astrocyte biology, and generate testable hypotheses for my future research.",

Neurons, however, are not the only cell types making up the nervous tissue. Astrocytes interact with neurons at the synaptic and network level. Astrocytic intracellular calcium dynamics integrates and modulates surrounding neural activity over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. Recent studies showed that these calcium transients encode information about external stimuli, and that this information is complementary to that encoded in neural activity, suggesting that astrocytes may play an active role in computations carried out in neural circuits. Here, I will investigate the role of astrocytes in shaping neural population, focusing on representations of space in the mouse the hippocampus during navigation. By using biophysically plausible network modeling and information theory I will characterize how the dynamics and information coding properties of networks of neurons are enhanced when they interact with astrocytes. The model will be constrained and guided by analysis of simultaneous dual-imaging recordings of neurons and astrocytes. Then I will consider new data, provided by the secondment lab, of longitudinal neural recordings during which astrocytic calcium dynamics was chemogenetically manipulated during the exploration of familiar and new environments over days. I will determine the causal role of astrocytes in neural information processing by using information theory and machine learning to analyze neural information coding when astrocytes are or are not perturbed.

So far, however, robotic manipulation technology has struggled in managing the uncertainty and unstructuredness that characterize human environments.\nMachine learning is a natural approach -- the robot can adapt to a given scenario, even if it was not programmed to handle it beforehand. Indeed, Deep Reinforcement Learning (deep RL), which has recently led to AI breakthroughs in computer games, has been publicized as the learning-based approach to robotics. To date, however, deep RL studies focused on known and observable systems, where uncertainty was resolved by lengthy trial and error. Quickly learning to act in novel environments, as required for robotics, is not yet within our reach.\nThe crux of the matter is the tight coupling between perception and control under high uncertainty -- the robot must actively reduce uncertainty while also trying to solve the task; for complex and high-dimensional systems, we do not have a suitable algorithmic framework for this.\n\nIn this proposal, our overarching goal is to: \nDevelop the algorithmic framework of using deep learning in problems that tightly couple perception, planning, and control, for advancing robotic AI to reliably manipulate general objects in unstructured environments.\n\nTowards this end, we shall develop neural network representations of uncertainty, and algorithms that estimate uncertainty from data. We will develop theory and algorithms for decision making under uncertainty, bringing in a fresh perspective to the problem based on Bayesian reinforcement learning (Bayes-RL). These advances will allow us to study safety certificates for deep RL, and develop a general and practical methodology for learning-based robotic manipulation under uncertainty, validated on real robot experiments.

            "objective": "Despite the impressive advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), current robotic solutions fall short of the expectations when they are requested to operate in partially unknown environments. Most of all, robots lack the cognitive capabilities to understand a task to the point of being able to perform it in a different domain. As humans, during the learning process we gain deep insights on the execution of a process, which allows us to replicate its execution in a different domain with a little effort. We are also able to invert the task execution and to react to contingencies, by focusing the attention to the most critical prediction phases. However, replicating these cognitive processes in AI-driven robots is challenging as it needs a profound rethinking of the robot learning paradigm itself. The robot needs to understand how to act and imagine, like humans do, the possible consequences of its actions in another domain. This demands for a novel framework that embraces different levels of abstraction, starting from physical interaction with the environment, passing through active perception and understanding, and ending-up with decision-making. The INVERSE project aims to provide robots with these essential cognitive abilities by adopting a continual learning approach. After an initial bootstrap phase, used to create initial knowledge from human-level specifications, the robot refines its repertoire by capitalising on its own experience and on human feedback. This experience-driven strategy permits to frame different problems, like performing a task in a different domain, as a problem of fault detection and recovery. Humans have a central role in INVERSE, since their supervision helps limit the complexity of the refinement loop, making the solution suitable for deployment in production scenarios. The effectiveness of developed solutions will be demonstrated in two complementary use cases designed to be a realistic instantiation of the actual work environments.",

            "objective": "Recent years have witnessed tremendous progress in the field of Machine Learning (ML). Learning algorithms are applied in an ever-increasing variety of contexts, ranging from engineering challenges such as self-driving cars all the way to societal contexts involving private data. These developments pose important challenges (i) Many of the recent breakthroughs demonstrate phenomena that lack explanations, and sometimes even contradict conventional wisdom. One main reason for this is because classical ML theory adopts a worst-case perspective which is too pessimistic to explain practical ML: in reality data is rarely worst-case, and experiments indicate that often much less data is needed than predicted by traditional theory. (ii) The increase in ML applications that involve private and sensitive data highlights the need for algorithms that handle the data responsibly. While this need has been addressed by the field of Differential Privacy (DP), the cost of privacy remains poorly understood: How much more data does private learning require, compared to learning without privacy constraints? Inspired by these challenges, our guiding question is:  How much data is needed for learning? Towards answering this question we aim to develop a theory of generalization which complements the traditional theory and is better fit to model real-world learning tasks. We will base it on distribution-, data-, and algorithm-dependent perspectives. These complement the  distribution-free worst-case perspective of the classical theory, and are suitable for exploiting specific properties of a given learning task. We will use this theory to study various settings, including supervised, semisupervised, interactive, and private learning. We believe that this research will advance the field in terms of efficiency, reliability, and applicability. Furthermore, our work combines ideas from various areas in computer science and mathematics; we thus expect further impact outside our field.",

On the other hand, GENERALIZATION is focused on reformulating the theory of generalization in Machine Learning, with a particular emphasis on data efficiency, differential privacy, and the challenges posed by classical worst-case perspectives.

Here's a breakdown of how they satisfy each criterion: 1. Minor Objectives or Methods: Both projects focus on Edge AI, though TIRAMISU is broader in dealing with the hardware backbone design and innovation management, whereas EDGE-SA is more specific in exploring Systolic Arrays and Evolvable Hardware for computational acceleration. 2. Overlapping Goals and Methodologies: Both projects aim to address the challenges of computational efficiency and resource constraints in Edge AI, but EDGE-SA's specific focus on Systolic Arrays and its real-world application context of indoor tracking provide distinct elements. 3. Key Similarities but Retained Distinctions: The projects share key objectives such as enhancing the performance and efficiency of Edge AI devices. However, TIRAMISU is more comprehensive, tackling the broader aspects of innovation, workforce training, and engineering challenges, while EDGE-SA focuses narrowly on specific acceleration techniques and their applications. 4. Alignment and Resource Efficiency: The alignment in their scope of improving Edge AI's efficiency and reliability suggests that merging these projects could improve resource efficiency. By combining TIRAMISU's interdisciplinary training and innovation management with EDGE-SA's technical exploration of specific acceleration techniques, the merged project could potentially offer a more holistic approach to the challenges in Edge AI. However, given their different focal points, they could still function independently with some loss of efficiency. 5. Near Identical Scope and Inefficiency in Separation: While there are close overlaps, the projects are not nearly identical and retain enough unique aspects that their combination is beneficial but not absolutely necessary. In summary, merging the projects would likely benefit the overall research output and resource efficiency, especially by combining broad and specific focuses within Edge AI. Yet, the projects also include enough distinct elements to allow them to operate independently if needed. Thus, the final evaluation leans towards a high degree of similarity while recommending consideration for merging due to the substantial benefits it would bring.",

In Europe alone, more than 340,000 people are diagnosed with colorectal cancer each year. While treatment options of CRC have expanded over the last decades, the survival rates of patients suffering from advanced-stage cancers remain poor. Stemness of neoplastic cells has been proposed as a major factor in treatment resistance and high relapse rates, however, drugs targeting stem cell signaling pathways in cancer are still lacking today. We propose developing and validating a new drug discovery platform based on patient-derived organoids (PDOs) and machine learning-assisted phenotypic target validation and drug discovery. Using this platform, we have previously shown that we can identify a broad spectrum of phenotypes beyond lethality, including drug-induced changes in stemness of PDOs. As part of the EIC Open Transition project, we will validate our next-generation platform for identifying therapeutics to target stem cell signaling pathways in CRC. Based on results by us showing that an interaction of MEK and Wnt signaling shifts the balance between stemness and differentiated cells, we will target Wnt pathways as a demonstrator for the technology. The ACHILLEUS project targets critical vulnerabilities in cancer and is based on technologies and approaches developed during previous ERC Advanced and ERC Proof-of-Concept grant-funded projects. The project?s ultimate aim is to spin out a NewCo as a phenotypic drug discovery platform for targeting cancer stem cell pathways.",

The trend towards increased autonomy conveys augmented problems concerning reliability, resilience, and trust for autonomous robots in open worlds. The essence of the problem can be traced to robots suffering from a lack of understanding of what is going on and a lack of awareness of their role in it. This is a problem that artificial intelligence approaches based on machine learning are not addressing well. Autonomous robots do not fully understand their open environments, their complex missions, their intricate realizations, and the unexpected events that affect their performance. An improvement in the capability to understand of autonomous robots is needed. This project tries to provide a solution to this need in the form of 1) a theory of understanding, 2) a theory of awareness, 3) reusable software assets to apply these theories in real robots, and 4) three demonstrations of its capability to a) augment resilience of drone teams, b) augment flexibility of manufacturing robots, and c) augment human alignment of social robots. In summary, we will develop a cognitive architecture for autonomous robots based on a formal concept of understanding, supporting value-oriented situation understanding and self-awareness to improve robot flexibility, resilience and explainability.",

            "objective": "Despite the impressive advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), current robotic solutions fall short of the expectations when they are requested to operate in partially unknown environments. Most of all, robots lack the cognitive capabilities to understand a task to the point of being able to perform it in a different domain. As humans, during the learning process we gain deep insights on the execution of a process, which allows us to replicate its execution in a different domain with a little effort. We are also able to invert the task execution and to react to contingencies, by focusing the attention to the most critical prediction phases. However, replicating these cognitive processes in AI-driven robots is challenging as it needs a profound rethinking of the robot learning paradigm itself. The robot needs to understand how to act and imagine, like humans do, the possible consequences of its actions in another domain. This demands for a novel framework that embraces different levels of abstraction, starting from physical interaction with the environment, passing through active perception and understanding, and ending-up with decision-making. The INVERSE project aims to provide robots with these essential cognitive abilities by adopting a continual learning approach. After an initial bootstrap phase, used to create initial knowledge from human-level specifications, the robot refines its repertoire by capitalising on its own experience and on human feedback. This experience-driven strategy permits to frame different problems, like performing a task in a different domain, as a problem of fault detection and recovery. Humans have a central role in INVERSE, since their supervision helps limit the complexity of the refinement loop, making the solution suitable for deployment in production scenarios. The effectiveness of developed solutions will be demonstrated in two complementary use cases designed to be a realistic instantiation of the actual work environments.",

Extensive research efforts have been dedicated to refining individual turbine efficiency and optimizing tidal farms to maximize energy output. However, as tidal farms scale up, there's a consequential rise in noise emissions that can prove detrimental to underwater ecosystems. This issue necessitates a dedicated focus on the development of noise-reducing farms. While tidal turbine design has, to date, been focused on energy production, fatigue load and lifespan of the blades and paid little attention to the acoustic footprint and subsequent effects on the environment, it is urgent to design silent energy farms to reduce the noise impact on local fauna.\nFarm-noise intends to: 1) characterise individual tidal turbines and construct simple models (surrogates) for their representation; 2) provide mechanisms for the acoustic control/minimisation. We will characterize tidal turbines and farms using computational fluid dynamics and large eddy simulations. Based on the simulations and the extracted physical insight, accurate surrogate models for turbines and associated acoustics will be developed to enable optimization of farms that minimize noise while ensuring energy production. Machine learning based reinforcement learning methodologies will be used to optimize and control the trade-off between energy production and noise emission. Compromises between energy and sound generation will finally be reached automatically for specific sites taking into account ambient conditions and local fauna.\nThe expected research results will not only provide theoretical and methodological support for the design and silent operation of large tidal farms but also promote the ecological sustainability of the tidal industry.

A major goal of modern physics is to extend this knowledge to out-of-equilibrium systems. Located at the boundary between equilibrium and nonequilibrum, quantum simulation appears particularly suitable for this purpose. Using periodic drives, quantum simulators can experimentally emulate phenomena hitherto inaccessible in conventional materials, such as artificial gauge fields or topological and dynamically localized matter. However, our understanding of how to manipulate systems exposed to intense nonequilibrium drives is in its infancy, especially regarding strongly interacting models. \nWe propose to overcome the current limitations by combining ideas from quantum control and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. We will develop a new theoretical framework for nonadiabatic many-body state control on top of strong periodic drives underlying the optimal manipulation of ordered prethermal states of matter without equilibrium counterparts. Understanding this many-body dynamics will improve cutting-edge manipulation techniques in cold atoms, trapped ions, superconducting circuits, and quantum solids. \nWe will add reinforcement learning (RL), one of the most promising techniques in AI, to the quantum entanglement control toolbox. Deep RL has the potential to push the state-of-the-art of (dis-)entangling quantum states since it is capable of identifying effective degrees of freedom even when no underlying physical structure is immediately obvious.\nDiscovering guiding principles of physics for many-body control away from equilibrium has the potential to reveal new connections across quantum dynamics, statistical mechanics, optimal control, and machine learning.

It is anticipated to play a central role in the design and operation of future 6G networks. Despite the promise of AI, there remain many obstacles to its use in communication networks. The introduction of software defined elements such as radio access network (RAN) intelligent controllers (RIC) enables multi-party applications for the control and management of networks. However, AI functions are still nascent and such structures do not extend to optical networks or multi-controller environments. \n6G-XCEL seeks to address these challenges through research on high edge network use cases that employ multi-party AI controls running over compute accelerators to coordinate control across radio and optical networks. It will develop a reference framework for AI in 6G that will pave the way towards global validation, adoption and standardisation of AI approaches. This framework will enable decentralised AI-based network controls across network domains and physical layers, while promoting security and sustainable implementations. Using the latest AI algorithms and data compression, research on the resulting decentralised multi-party, multi-network AI (DMMAI) framework will enable the development of reference use cases, data and model repositories, curated training and evaluation data, as well as technologies for its use as a benchmarking platform for future AI/ML solutions for 6G networks.\n6G-XCEL will bring together a large ecosystem of researchers from the EU and US to implement elements of the DMMAI framework in their testbeds and labs, integrating it into their research programs and validating the framework across platforms. Working with standardisation groups within each jurisdiction, 6G-XCEL will achieve joint progress towards large scale application of AI in 6G networks.",

However, their specific applications and contexts (Embedded AI systems vs. AI in 6G networks) diverge significantly.\n\n- **Overlapping Goals and Methodologies**: Both projects aim to advance AI technologies and have overlapping goals such as enhancing AI\u2019s robustness, security, and scalability. They also share a goal of pushing forward AI; however, they are operating in different domains which justifies awarding a second point.\n\n- **Key Similarities in Scope, Methodology, and Innovation**: Both projects involve interdisciplinary research and innovative methodologies to address their respective challenges, scoring a third point here. Nevertheless, their scopes\u2014one focusing on Embedded AI systems and applications, and the other on AI\u2019s role in 6G communication networks\u2014remain distinct enough to proceed as separate entities. Merging the projects might only yield moderate benefits as the contexts and specific objectives differ.\n\n- **Alignment in Scope for Resource Efficiency**: While merging would likely improve resource efficiency slightly, it is not substantial enough to warrant it. The projects could benefit from shared learnings and collaboration rather than a full merger, as combining their operations might dilute the focus on their distinct goals. Therefore, a fourth point is not warranted.\n\n- **Nearly Identical in Scope, Methodology, and Innovation**: The two projects are not identical in scope, methodology, or innovation. Their differences in domain applications and specific research objectives prevent a full merger from being the most efficient pathway.\n\nGiven these considerations, the projects share enough similarities to justify some level of collaboration but retain sufficient distinctions in their specific objectives and application domains to benefit more from staying as separate but cooperative entities rather than merging outright.",

It relies on electronic components that could replicate the functioning of neurons and synapses. Designing such novel electronics needs the development of cost-effective, fast and reliable materials with tunable functionality. A fundamental understanding of these materials will pave the foundation of innovative device designs and strategies for their large-scale integration for neuromorphic architectures. In this context, the proposed project intends to deliver artificial neurons by developing thin-films of a novel material (TbMnO3) that is capable of demonstrating a Negative Differential Resistance (NDR). The idea is to utilise the fundamental understanding of multi-dimensional (electrical, optical, mechanical and magnetic) control of NDR which is not explored yet and is possible in TbMnO3. NDR enables a two-terminal device to display self-oscillations due to applied electrical spikes. The spiking electrical currents could be used to govern the behaviour of these oscillations and emulating the leaky, integrate, and fire behaviour of biological neurons. Once such a performance is achieved, the device will further be integrated into oscillatory neural networks array for demonstration of complex computing tasks such as image recognition and imitating human behaviour.    \n\nThe project will unite the applicant\u2019s expertise in synaptic devices and materials engineering with the extensive experience of the host-labs in thin-film and neuromorphic devices.

Novel brain-inspired or neuromorphic chips working with biologically-inspired spiking neural networks have gained attention as they promise highly efficient ways to process data. Important research effort has been dedicated to develop such neuromorphic systems in electronic or photonic hardware separately, each with its drawbacks and limitations. SPIKEPro proposes a science-towards-technology breakthrough by combining low-energy electrical and photonic neurons into a joint spiking neural network on an integrated circuit. SPIKEPro\u2019s chip integration approach is based on a common technology platform, connecting ultrafast laser optical neurons with efficient electrical spiking diodes through non-volatile synaptic weights. This enables to simultaneously capitalise on the advantages of both electronics and photonics to deliver efficient and high-speed SNNs going beyond existing implementations. In addition to reducing the energy consumption per spike in the network, SPIKEPro will also develop novel learning strategies and algorithms able to work with reduced number of synaptic connections. These will be possible by exploiting the hardware parameters of the electrical and photonic spiking devices. The outcome of SPIKEPro will have lasting economic, societal and scientific impact.

It is expected that the emerging sustainable AI methods can be efficiently deployed in the edge-cloud continuum on different hardware platforms and computing infrastructure depending on the real-world task scenarios and constraints including the limited energy budget. In response to this growing demand and emerging trends we propose to adopt a brain-like approach to AI system design due to its promising potential for functional flexibility, hardware friendliness as well as energy efficiency among others. To this end, EXTRA-BRAIN is aimed at developing a new generation of AI solutions based on brain-like neural networks that enable us to overcome key limitations of the current state-of-the-art methods, exemplified by deep learning, such as limited cross-task generalisation and extrapolation to novel domains (bounded reliability), excessive dependence on costly annotated data as well as extensive training and validation processes with heavy demand for compute resources at high energy cost, to name a few. The core brain-like neural network design in our approach derives from the accumulated computational neuroscience insights into the brain's working principles of information processing, key learning schemes and neuroanatomical structures that underlie the brain's perceptual/cognitive phenomena and its functional flexibility. Furthermore, these novel models are supported by data optimisation pipelines, which improve data quality, security and reduce the costs of assembling suitable training data, and an explainability framework to empower the human user. The proposed EXTRA-BRAIN framework will be examined in a diverse set of use cases with different hardware demands in the edge-cloud continuum.",

In our project, we will focus on neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), namely Alzheimer and Parkinsonism, as the NCDs under investigation.  \nCOMMUTE is a project characterized by the intelligent combination of two fundamentally different approaches: a hypotheses-free, data-driven approach is building on available big data and the application of cutting edge AI/ML technologies to answer the question, whether infection by SARS-CoV-2 causes effects that result in a higher risk for the development of NDDs at population-level. Complementary to that, a hypothesis-driven, knowledge-based approach leverages the substantial knowledge in the scientific community working on NDDs on the putative comorbidity mechanisms linking COVID and neurodegeneration. Both approaches are informing and supporting each other through an intensive crosstalk between computational and experimental biology methods.\nUnderstanding comorbidity between COVID and NDDs at causal level is the first goal of the COMMUTE project. The second goal is the translation of the actionable insights into personalized health applications.   \nOn the AI/ML side, the targeted outcome for translation into practice is a set of qualified biomarkers and predictive features that will be used for an AI-powered, model-generated recommender system that will allow for individualized risk assessment and personalized recommendations.

Of particular concern are the long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection with high and rising prevalence of chronic manifestations referred to as Post-COVID.

We pursue a multi scalar approach that reaches from epidemiology and mechanistic interrogation of host/virus interplay at single cell resolution through predictive modelling all the way to validation of biomarkers and repurposed drugs. The aim is to anticipate and effectively manage personalized trajectories of NeuroCOVID vulnerability and their impact at population level. For this we leverage two leading national health registries and three clinical cohorts to characterize the phenotypic spectrum of NeuroCOVID, its risk factors and its socioeconomic burden at high definition. We pioneer innovative robotics to scale brain organoid modelling and combine it with single cell multiOMICs and AI analytics to dissect the principles of the individual host response and render experimentally actionable the authentic genetic backgrounds of differential SARS-CoV-2 sensitivity.

This necessarily creates information-transmission bottlenecks at the interface between quantum and classical realms. These bottlenecks create scalability issues that prevent us from using existing architectures to the best of their capabilities and may even impair our ability to further scale up system sizes.\n\nIn this project, we adopt a unifying framework that takes into account all computing resources (quantum and classical). We develop quantum-to-classical converters to overcome information-transmission bottlenecks. Dubbed shadows, they leverage randomization, as well as quantum-enhanced readout strategies to obtain a succinct classical description of an underlying quantum system that can then be used to efficiently predict many features at once. The shadow paradigm is compatible with near-term quantum hardware and utilizes genuine quantum effects that do not have a classical counterpart. Building on these ideas, we also establish rigorous synergies between quantum experiments and classical machine learning. Shadow learning protocols use shadows to succinctly represent training data obtained from actual quantum experiments. A classical training stage then enables data-driven learning of genuine quantum phenomena. Finally, we develop new tools to ensure reliable execution on current quantum hardware, thus bridging the gap between theory and experiment.\n\nMy interdisciplinary skill set combines methods from modern computer science with quantum information and has already led to numerous high-impact contributions (e.g. 1 Nature Physics with more than 350 citations and 2 Science publications).

Data-driven applications using AI techniques are reshaping various industries such as manufacturing, tourism, and mobility. The European Strategy for Data aims to create a single market for data while ensuring Europe's global competitiveness and data sovereignty. This has led to the development of Common European data spaces, yet the governance of the data life cycle in organizations has not kept up with the rapid technology evolution and remains largely manual. This is especially evident in scenarios where tens or hundreds of continuously evolving data sources produce semi-structured data, and create significant challenges when governed manually, causing organizations to end up with data silos. A systematic and standardized mechanism is needed to ingest, integrate, and process data, thus boosting the ability to develop new data-centric business models. However, current research and development efforts typically target one aspect of the end-to-end data lifecycle, such as scalable data management, ML performance, AI explainability, or sharing, while dismissing its governance. To overcome this limitation, CyclOps proposes a new framework for the governance and maintenance of the complete data lifecycle for large-scale volumes of data generated in heterogeneous distributed sources to enable data sharing and exchange. CyclOps intelligently automates, by means of knowledge graphs (KGs) and with a human-in-the-loop approach, the generation and execution of data processing pipelines. KGs are the established formal models to represent data and metadata while providing context and guaranteeing interoperability with other systems adhering to the FAIR Guiding Principles. CyclOps will enable organizations to seamlessly provide, cross and analyze machine- and human-generated data from and for data spaces, thus facilitating the provision of added-value services on top.",

In this context, academic analysis is urgently needed, as well as suggesting a revision of the new regulations to EU policy-makers to facilitate responsible data sharing. DataCom aims at building a new framework to facilitate an ethical secondary use of health data held by public bodies, with the aim of improving accountability and enhancing responsible re-use. To build it, I will develop and test in intersectoral practical environments the innovative concept of 'Ethical Commodification': the possibility of exploiting personal data in an ethical way for the public good, in accordance with the data subject\u2019s expectations and needs and taking into account the risks associated with the exploitation of anonymized data sets, focusing on 3 Member States, Italy, Spain, and the Netherlands. In order to reach this objective, DataCom has a strong interdisciplinary and intersectoral approach, bridging law, ethics, and computer science, taking into consideration the needs of the public sector and those of citizens. To ensure the successful implementation of these project goals I will conduct my research at the University of Turin's Law Department, with the guidance of Prof. Ugo Pagallo, a leading scholar.

AI has been rapidly growing in various industries, from financial services to healthcare, education, and job recruitment. However, as AI algorithms have become increasingly sophisticated and pervasive in decision-making processes, concerns have arisen about their fairness and compliance with regulations. In particular, the EU AI Act requires that AI providers in high-risk applications -- such as employment, credit, or healthcare -- to identify (and thereby address) discrimination by their algorithms against certain demographics of people. However, ensuring compliance with the Act can be challenging, particularly for AI startups that may not have the resources or expertise to fully understand and implement the Act's requirements. Addressing existing disconnects between AI fairness toolkits' capabilities and current practitioner needs, the Act.AI tool can be easily integrated into any AI workflow, in a plug and play fashion, to continuously monitor and improve its fairness. A key aspect of Act.AI is the ability to operate with different types of data (tabular, images, and text) in a variety of contexts (binary and multiclass classification and regression). It is also able to match datasets in different domains including out-of-distribution data even if these datasets have different numbers of variables or features.

To effectively reduce GHGs, the emissions must be accurately quantified and unknown emitters found. However, measuring global GHG emissions is very challenging, and hence current emission inventories rely mostly on bottom-up calculations, which lack accuracy and the ability to detect unknown sources.\nIn CoSense4Climate, I will use the powerful mathematical theory of compressed sensing (CS) to revolutionize atmospheric inversion. My goal is to develop a method to locate, quantify, and attribute GHG emitters with unmatched spatial resolution and accuracy. CS has been used with great success in signal and image processing by taking advantage of the fact that most signals contain redundancies. Using CS in combination with domain transformations, I will generate accurate high resolution emission fields and reveal unknown sources, yet require less data than conventional methods. I will develop a CS inversion framework not only for local sensor data, but also for satellite data, which, upon success, will lead to a breakthrough in monitoring urban GHG emissions globally.\nI am best suited to reach this goal. I have gathered a unique dataset with my fully automated differential column GHG network MUCCnet, the first of its kind. With my rich experience in applying computational fluid dynamics (CFD), solar-induced fluorescence (SIF), and machine learning (ML) for estimating GHG emissions, I will additionally create a high-resolution CFD-based atmospheric transport model, a satellite SIF-based urban CO2 biogenic flux model, and a ML method for source attribution based on ratios of GHG and air pollutant concentrations.\nCoSense4Climate will establish a new standard for GHG emission monitoring, and provide ground-breaking scientific methods to help solve one of today\u2019s most urgent problem: climate change.",

To combat these issues, new and more stringent green regulations are being implemented globally, which existing air monitoring systems are not well equipped to handle. Currently available commercial sensors are expensive, bulky, and frequently require shelter and power from the mains. Field performance also often falls lower than required due to high signal noise and drift. Consequently, there is a need for new air pollution and GHG monitoring systems that offer improved sensitivity, precision, and accuracy while also being inexpensive, compact, and energy efficient. RAVEN will develop the next generation of gas sensing systems, consisting of two miniaturised gas sensors implementing cutting-edge PIC technology, one in the VIS-SWIR range and one in the MIR range. These sensors will work in tandem across a broad wavelength range (600-3000 nm) to measure concentrations of multiple pollutants and GHGs, including CO2, CO, O3, CH4, N2O, CH3OH, NH3, NO2 in 1-25 ppb LOD range. The sensors will leverage cutting-edge science, including developing a high-power compact dual-supercontinuum source on a chip and on-chip data analysis using a quantum-inspired approach for improved LOD and selectivity of gases and to satisfy the performance, power consumption, size, and cost requirements of end users. \nRAVEN will offer an unparalleled, high-performance multi-sensing solution that can be packaged into a single near-universally applicable miniaturised system. The implementation of RAVEN technology will provide Europe with the necessary resources to ensure compliance with the EU Green Deal and enhance the photonic technology capabilities of the EU.",

At the basis of these successes, there is representation learning, which enables training deep neural networks in an unsupervised fashion and provides the starting conditions for subsequent task-specific training. However, current representation learning strategies use large neural networks and consume large amount of data, thus being data and energy inefficient. In contrast, humans learn from limited data in a very efficient way. This is due to the fact that humans are able to perform reasoning, while representation learning strategies lack such capability. This research project aims to overcome these limitations by providing the mathematical foundations for the integration between unsupervised learning and reasoning AI systems based on logic. Specifically, the aim is to devise algorithms enabling the discovery of symbolic representations from noisy/ambiguous data together with their relations and being able to adapt the acquired relational knowledge over time. The resulting solutions will be applied to improve image understanding in autonomous driving and to gain insights about causal reasoning and learning symbolic abstractions in mathematical domains.",

These huge models, often engineered by large corporations benefiting from huge computational resources, typically require learning a billion or more of parameters. They have proven to be very effective in solving prediction tasks in computer vision, natural language processing, and computational biology, for example, but they mostly remain black boxes that are hard to interpret, computationally demanding, and not robust to small data perturbations.\nWith a strong emphasis on visual modeling, the grand challenge of APHELEIA is to develop a new generation of machine learning models that are more robust, interpretable, and efficient, and do not require massive amounts of data to produce accurate predictions. To achieve this objective, we will foster new interactions between classical signal processing, statistics, optimization, and modern deep learning. Our goal is to reduce the need for massive data by enabling scientists and engineers to design trainable machine learning models that directly encode a priori knowledge of the task semantics and data formation process, while automatically prefering simple and stable solutions over complex ones. These models will be built on solid theoretical foundations with convergence and robustness guarantees, which are important to make real-life trustworthy predictions in the wild. We will implement these ideas in an open-source software toolbox readily applicable to visual recognition and inverse imaging problems, which will also handle other modalities. This will stimulate interdisciplinary collaborations, with the potential to be a game changer in the way scientists and engineers design machine learning problems.",

Instead of manually creating complex software, engineers now use automatically generated deep neural networks (DNNs) in critical financial, medical and transportation systems, obtaining previously unimaginable results.\n\nDespite their remarkable achievements, DNNs remain opaque. We do not understand their decision making and cannot prove their correctness - thus risking potentially devastating outcomes. For example, it has been shown that DNNs that navigate autonomous aircraft with the goal of avoiding collisions could produce incorrect turning advisories. Thus, the lack of formal guarantees regarding DNN behavior is preventing their safe deployment in critical systems, and could jeopardize human lives. Consequently, there is a crucial need to ensure that DNNs operate correctly.\n\nRecent and exciting developments in formal verification allow us to automatically reason about DNNs. However, this is a nascent technology, which currently only scales to medium-sized DNNs - whereas real-world systems are much larger. Additionally, it is unclear how to apply this technology in practice. I propose to bridge this crucial gap through the development of novel, scalable and groundbreaking techniques for verifying the correctness of large DNNs, and by applying them to real systems of interest. I will do this by (1) developing search-space pruning techniques, which will enable us to verify larger DNNs; (2) creating novel abstraction-refinement techniques, which will allow us to scale to even larger DNNs; and (3) identifying new kinds of relevant specifications and key domains where DNNs are used, demonstrating the verification of real-world DNNs.\n\nThis project will result in a sound and expressive framework for automatically reasoning about DNNs, orders of magnitude larger than is possible today. This framework will ensure the safety and correctness of DNNs deployed in critical systems, greatly benefiting users and society.",

The model framework will fuse output from a novel physically-based glacier evolution model with all relevant observations available for each glacier, such as in-situ, geodetic and gravimetry-derived mass balances, as well as snowlines and other observations, thus simultaneously exploiting the untapped strengths of different types of observational data sets in an optimal manner.",

            "objective": "Estimating the ice volume of Earth's glaciers is a grand challenge of Earth System science. Besides being a critical parameter to model glacier evolution, knowledge of glacier volume is fundamental to quantify global sea level rise and available freshwater resources. Under current global warming glaciers are losing mass, making improved glacier ice volume estimates a top-priority to constrain future climate scenarios. Direct glacier ice volume estimates are limited by difficulty in directly measuring the ice thickness. As a result, estimates rely on models, many of which depend on explicit physical laws but require parameters often poorly constrained. Today, the amount of satellite data is increasing at such a rate that it cannot be efficiently exploited by traditional processing pipelines. At the same time, Artificial Intelligence techniques are becoming increasingly dominant problem-solving techniques. In particular, deep learning models have recently shown the ability to surpass human accuracy in many scientific tasks. The goal of the SKYNET project is to develop an innovative deep learning-based model capable of exploiting the huge amount of available satellite data to improve the current estimates of ice volumes of all Earth\u2019s glaciers, from continental alpine glaciers to polar glaciers, including those in the periphery of Greenland and Antarctica. The proposed methodology makes use of state-of-the art image inpainting architectures fed with satellite-based digital elevation models (TanDEM-X,REMA), altimetry (NASA\u2019s ICESat-2), gravity and ice surface velocity data to infer subglacial topographies hence ice volumes. Modelled topographies will be constrained towards realistic solutions using glacier ice thickness measurements (GlaThiDa repository) from in-situ and remotely sensed observations. SKYNET will be jointly developed by two leading institutions in glaciology and remote sensing: the University of Venice and the University of California Irvine.",

While AI-enabled digital health services and products are rapidly expanding in volume and variety, most of the AI innovations remain in the form of proof-of-concept. There is a continuous debate regarding whether AI is worthy of trust. The EU AI HLEG has defined that trustworthy AI systems should be lawful, ethical and robust. To translate it into actionable practices, provision of explainability, fairness and privacy is crucial. A considerable volume of research has been conducted in the areas of explainable AI, fair AI and privacy-preserving AI. However, the current research efforts to tackle the three challenges are fragmented and have culminated in a variety of solutions with heterogeneous, non-interoperable, or even conflicting capabilities.  The ambitious vision of HarmonicAI is to build a human-machine collaborative multi-objective design framework to foster coherently explainable, fair and privacy-preserving AI for digital health. HarmonicAI draws together proven experts in AI, health care, IoT, data science, privacy, cyber security, software engineering, HCI and industrial design with an underlying common aim to develop concrete technical and operational guidelines for AI practitioners to design human-centered, domain-specific, requirement-oriented trustworthy AI solutions, accelerating the scalable deployment of AI-powered digital health services and offering assurance to the public that AI in digital health is being developed and used in an ethical and trustworthy manner.",

CSI allows the SMARTEDGE solution to interact with devices according to a (i) standardized semantic interface, via a (ii) continuous conversion process based on declarative mappings and scalable from edge to cloud, and (iii) providing a declarative approach for the creation and orchestration of apps based on swarm intelligence. DSW provides (i) automatic discovery and dynamic network swarm formation in near real time, (ii) hardware-accelerated in-network operations for context-aware swarm networking, and (iii) embedded network security. The low-code tool chain provides (i) semantic-driven multimodal stream fusion for Edge devices; (ii) swarm elasticity via Edge-Cloud Interplay; (iii) adaptive coordination and optimization; (iv) cross-layer toolchain for Device-Edge-Cloud Continuum.

MultiMiner unlocks the potential of EO data, including Copernicus, commercial satellites, upcoming missions, airborne and low altitude as well as in situ data, to support the entire mining life cycle including mineral exploration, operational, closure and post-closure stages. This is achieved by creating generic but highly innovative machine learning solutions which do not require any or only little ground truth data. The project focuses on new EO based exploration technologies for critical raw materials (CRM) to increase the probability of finding new sources within EU thereby strengthening the EU autonomy in the area of raw materials. MultiMiner EO based exploration solutions have extremely low environmental impact, and are thus socially acceptable, economically efficient and improve safety. The project\u2019s solutions for mine site monitoring increase the transparency of mining operations as environmental impacts can be detected as early as possible and digital information of the currently unexploitable raw materials can be stored for future generations. The applicability of the developed algorithms is demonstrated in 4 European test sites. MultiMiner is a pan-European consortium consisting of 12 partners and 1 associated partner from research institutes, academia, consulting businesses and mining industry with interdisciplinary backgrounds in geology, remote sensing and machine learning. The members come from six EU member states which represent mining regions across Europe with diverse geology with evident potential for various types of CRM resources and thousands of operational and closed mines.",

To understand the nature of our visual representations that underlie this ability, a central goal of cognitive neuroscience is to determine the properties \u2013 or dimensions \u2013 that make up our representational space of objects. While much progress has been made at identifying the building blocks of visual processing in brain and cognition, our scientific understanding of visual representations remains fundamentally limited by (1) our ability to capture the complexity and variability of our visual world for determining the dimensions underlying our object representations and (2) the difficulty in disentangling visual and semantic contributions to these representations. COREDIM is an ambitious, interdisciplinary program that aims at overcoming these limitations and provide a detailed, interpretable characterization of the core dimensions underlying visual object representations. To reach this goal, COREDIM capitalizes on extensive, targeted sampling of behavioral and neuroimaging data and cutting-edge artificial intelligence methods that allow the identification of interpretable representational dimensions. Project 1 aims at uncovering the core representational dimensions of objects across ventral visual cortex, using a biologically-inspired neural network model tailored to each individual\u2019s functional neuroanatomy and trained to identify the most informative stimuli. Project 2 will identify the relative role of vision and semantic knowledge in shaping our core representational dimensions, through experimental manipulations at the level of the stimulus, task, and with cross-species comparisons.

To tap into this resource, the brain?s visual system engages in complex, intertwined computations to actively sample, extract, and integrate information across space and time. Surprisingly however, the integrative nature of vision hardly plays a role in the way we approach it in experimentation and computational modelling. Instead, higher-level vision is commonly treated as a largely bottom-up categorization process.\n \nTIME proposes a new approach. It will allow us to study vision in a more natural setting and as a process that is (a) geared towards semantic understanding instead of label-based categorisation, (b) naturally intertwined with active information sampling and (c) expanding across multiple timeframes, including network dynamics that unfold within and across eye fixations. This will be accomplished by an ambitious, three-step work program that combines cutting-edge non-invasive human brain imaging performed while participants visually explore tens of thousands of rich human-annotated natural scenes, the development of novel multivariate analysis techniques, and large-scale computational modelling using a new bio-inspired deep learning framework for active vision that closes the sensory-motor loop. Using this interdisciplinary approach, TIME will establish, for the first time, when, where, and how visual semantic understanding emerges in the brain as it actively samples and integrates information from the world in a continuously updating and dynamic decision process. These ground-breaking developments both in experimentation and deep neural network modelling build towards a fundamental paradigm shift in how we study, model, and understand vision, yielding new insights into its complex neural processes operating in more natural, ecologically valid conditions, as well as a closer alignment between biological and synthetic vision.",

A key enabler of its progress is the ability to train large, highly-accurate Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in a distributed fashion, across tens to thousands of different computational nodes. Yet, DNN training at scale poses severe challenges to standard paradigms in distributed computing; existing distributed training approaches and their practical implementations, via training libraries such as PyTorch or TensorFlow, often suffer from major distribution bottlenecks, which can significantly reduce computational efficiency, leading to wasted time, money, and energy.\n\nThe FastML proof-of-concept (PoC) project will tackle this efficiency challenge head-on, by introducing a distributed training framework that will significantly reduce or even eliminate the overheads of parallelization for practical distributed training workloads, in common usage scenarios. FastML\u2019s distinctive feature is leveraging the algorithmic and software techniques developed by our ERC Starting Grant, in order to reduce distribution overheads at scale without impacting training convergence or model accuracy. FastML stands in contrast to current distribution techniques, which rely on hardware overprovisioning\u2013essentially, providing very fast but also very expensive interconnects between the computing nodes. As such, FastML can bring significant infrastructure and running cost improvements to its users, as well as lowering the cost and hardware entry barrier to training accurate machine learning models. The PoC will design and develop the FastML software library to target industry-relevant workloads via pilot projects jointly with our industrial partners. In addition, we will perform an in-depth market study, devise intellectual property and go-to-market strategies, and produce a minimally-viable product (MVP), which will be demonstrated to potential customers and investors.",

This hierarchy allows a DL model to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones. A graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep, and thus its name. A Deep neural network (DNN) is based on an artificial neural network model, and its core strength is that there is no need for human assistance to formally specify all the knowledge that the model needs. This makes DNNs represent the state of the art in Artificial Intelligence (AI). Despite their top performance and ubiquity of applications (from Healthcare to autonomous cars), DNNs suffer serious shortcomings. First, DNNs are considered black box models, i.e., with complex and opaque algorithms, hard to interpret and diagnose. Second, they suffer from bias, and the testing protocols for automatic recognition are not fair, as they learn patterns in the data that are not correlated to the output; e.g. they may focus on areas outside the lung in X ray images to predict the presence of COVID-19. Although DNNs outperform many other methods, they often are not right for the right reasons (RRR). RRR-XAI tackles this mismatch and bridges this gap through a tight integration of DL and symbolic AI, with the principal objective of making DL explainable. To achieve this I will follow the rationale behind XAI under the RRR philosophy and perform analyses to understand two types of phenomena that cause trouble in DNNs. Second, I will use: 1) Domain knowledge expertise as supporting evidence to explain a particular model output; 2) Neural-Symbolic computation to communicate the explanation of such phenomena in natural language. I will study two practical use cases where supporting explanations of the model output are critical: a) COVID-19 prediction from chest X-Ray images, and b) Weapon detection in alarm systems and crowds from images.",

To do so, we plan to design several practical cryptographic schemes (Functional Encryption and Hybrid Homomorphic Encryption) for analyzing data in a privacy-preserving way. Besides processing statistical data in a privacy-preserving way, we also aim to enable a richer, more balanced and comprehensive approach where data analytics and cryptography go hand in hand with a shift towards increased privacy. In HARPOCRATES we will first show how to effectively combine cryptography with the principles of differential privacy to secure and privatise databases. Next, we will build privacy-preserving machine learning models able to classify encrypted data by performing high accuracy predictions directly on ciphertexts across federated data spaces. Finally, to demonstrate how these solutions respond to users\u2019 needs, we will implement two real-world cross-border data sharing scenarios related to health data analysis for sleep medicine and threat intelligence for local authorities.",

They share common goals related to privacy-preserving machine learning and data analytics over decentralized or federated networks, but each approaches these problems from different angles and with different methodologies. Merging these projects could bring moderate benefits to resource efficiency and research outputs, but they also have distinct innovations and objectives that warrant keeping them separate.

The introduction of software defined elements such as radio access network (RAN) intelligent controllers (RIC) enables multi-party applications for the control and management of networks. However, AI functions are still nascent and such structures do not extend to optical networks or multi-controller environments. \n6G-XCEL seeks to address these challenges through research on high edge network use cases that employ multi-party AI controls running over compute accelerators to coordinate control across radio and optical networks. It will develop a reference framework for AI in 6G that will pave the way towards global validation, adoption and standardisation of AI approaches. This framework will enable decentralised AI-based network controls across network domains and physical layers, while promoting security and sustainable implementations. Using the latest AI algorithms and data compression, research on the resulting decentralised multi-party, multi-network AI (DMMAI) framework will enable the development of reference use cases, data and model repositories, curated training and evaluation data, as well as technologies for its use as a benchmarking platform for future AI/ML solutions for 6G networks.\n6G-XCEL will bring together a large ecosystem of researchers from the EU and US to implement elements of the DMMAI framework in their testbeds and labs, integrating it into their research programs and validating the framework across platforms.

It will apply a novel, interdisciplinary approach, combining archaeobotany, computational archaeology and data science through practical training by the supervisory team that pioneered part of the proposed methodology.

Network science will be applied to reconstruct settlement connectivity in relation to a) their access to the introduced food plants, and b) their position within and access to the Roman transport network. Agent-Based Modelling and statistical analyses will be applied to further allow testing hypotheses concerning settlement position and hierarchy in relation to commerce to ultimately evaluate the role of the ancient transport network in the distribution and importance of urban centres and analyse to which degree these patterns have endured in time up to the modern period.

Two of the most important and lasting changes were the establishment of a new transport network and the large-scale development of cities. Connectivity continues to be seen as an essential factor in the analysis of the spread of urbanisation, migration, the ancient economy, and the transmission of ideas. In Antiquity connectivity could only be achieved via movement by land, river and sea, and had to rely on the available transport network. While roads have been extensively investigated and they have been reconstructed in detail in provinces such as Hispania, Galia and Britannia, to date, no analysis of Roman movement and communication has incorporated navigable rivers, lakes, canals and sea transport. Orbis, the only open geospatial tool for the analysis of Roman transport, only incorporates a few major rivers and a very simple network of sea routes, which pales in comparison with the number of sea and river quays, harbours and ports archaeologically documented. Both epigraphy and classical reliefs and texts indicate Romans developed, maintained and extended the network of inland waterways. Water transport was the preferred mode of transport for goods in bulk whenever possible as it was much cheaper than road transport and constituted the basis of international commerce.\nOverTheWaters will reconstruct waterways and sea routes of the Western Roman Empire using big data and advanced computational methods in order to understand the importance of water movement, transport and shipbuilding technology and how it influenced the development of urban centres acting as commercial hubs and consumption and redistribution foci.",

But how does the cortical network implement this continual learning while avoiding interference and catastrophic overwriting of prior events? While cell assemblies with simple point neurons are thought to serve as the basic learning and storage units, this model poses major challenges in dynamic environments and lacks experimental support. Relying on strong preliminary results, I here propose a radically different view of learning and storage in the cortex\u2014the dendrite assembly hypothesis\u2014where the relevant memory units are the \"hidden layer\" of dendritic branches. Namely, each neuron operates as a small network, with different dendrite assemblies representing different tasks and driving the soma. The dendrite assembly model augments the cell assembly model, potentially alleviating problems of interference, sparsity and capacity. We will test the dendrite assembly hypothesis in the mouse motor cortex, where learning is perpetual and coding is dense. This will entail determining dendritic and somatic representations during continual learning, thus deciphering the core learning units of the network (Aim1), the pathways (Aim2) and structural plasticity (Aim3) that enable dendrite assembly formation and learning; and the consequences of the dendrite assembly model for the pathogenesis of Parkinson\u2019s disease (Aim4). We will record from somas, dendrites and spines of pyramidal tract neurons at single-cell and population levels with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution, using state-of-the-art in-vivo imaging, a novel behavioral design, and an analysis platform we developed. Our results are expected to transform our view of how cortical neurons represent multiple motor memories in the healthy and Parkinsonian brain, open avenues for developing novel treatment modalities for Parkinson\u2019s disease and inspire new artificial intelligence network architectures.",

            "objective": "Neuroscience research tries to tease apart how brain circuits work together to give rise to behaviour, namely cognitive flexible processes, such as reinforcement learning (RL). RL requires neurons to be tuned to relevant inputs in order to maximize behavioural performance. Most of the excitatory synaptic inputs in pyramidal neurons are located in the thin dendrites where the majority of the spines are located. Thus, thin dendrites play a crucial role in synaptic integration and experience-dependent plasticity. They mediate local computations that endow single neurons with a variety of input\u2013output transformations and change their information transfer. In agreement, individual dendrites have been proposed as the fundamental computational unit of neurons and the substrate for increasing the computational power of the brain. On the other hand, the neuromodulatory systems are known to be critical regulators of brain states and of adaptive responses relevant to RL. Different neuromodulators, acting through their receptors, can alter intrinsic properties of dendritic ion channels and receptors and synaptic efficacy, having a direct impact on dendritic computations. Thus, in order to understand how the brain allows to quickly improve behavioural performance during RL, it is critical that we 1) gain insight about the activity on thin dendrites, 2) to systematically understand the activity of different neuromodulatory inputs on those and 3) their impact on RL. This proposal aims at identifying how neurons change their properties during RL, by observing and manipulating the neurophysiology of behaving mice, using interdisciplinary approaches and state-of-the-art methods. The work will address several original questions: 1) what is the role of tuft dendritic activity to implement an adequate RL?; 2) what is the role of different neuromodulators in shaping the tuft dendritic activity and on RL?",

ACI effects are expected to change dramatically as we enter a post-fossil world, characterized by strong reductions in anthropogenic aerosol emissions but with increasingly larger impacts from natural aerosols. Although we expect cleaner clouds compared to today, ACI in this post-fossil state may considerably differ from preindustrial conditions, owing to shifts in climate and changes in sources region characteristics. CleanCloud will address the major gaps impeding robust ACI assessments, improve their representation in current and next generation kilometer-scale climate models , quantify and understand their regional and temporal effects, and how they will evolve in the transition to the post-fossil regime. To accomplish this, CleanCloud will 1) carry out targeted field experiments in European climate hotspots; 2) develop state-of-the-art algorithms and analysis tools to obtain new proxies and diagnostics for key ACI-related processes; 3) contribute to the calibration and validation of  upcoming satellite missions in coordination with the satellite community; 4) improve and better constrain kilometer- and large-scale climate models using advanced machine learning, data assimilation and model calibration, confronting perturbed physics ensembles with existing and new satellite and in-situ data; and 5) assess the role of aerosols in the life cycle of convective systems, focusing on precipitation formation and the impacts on the hydrological cycle, and 6) enhance the exploitation of data centres, measurement programs, international campaigns, laboratory studies, and models.

            "objective": "Aerosol particles are ubiquitous constituents in the ambient atmosphere. Ultrafine particles (< 10 nm) show adverse effects on our public health, as inhalation leads to an elevated risk of lung- and cardiovascular diseases. Aerosol particles also influence the global climate, by scattering sunlight away from Earth's surface and acting as seeds for cloud droplet formation. Combined, these effects lead to an overall cooling of the Earth, directly counteracting the warming effect of greenhouse gases. According to the IPCC, aerosol particles pose the largest uncertainty in global climate forecast. This uncertainty is caused by the lack of understanding of the early growth behaviour of small (< 3 nm) particles. The largest source of aerosol particles (50-90%) is from nucleation of vapours in the air leading to a burst of freshly nucleated particles (FNPs) of 1-2 nm in size. However, even the basic fundamental properties of these FNPs remain unknown and cannot be studied using currently available experimental techniques. I propose a unique approach to target the properties of FNPs by applying a versatile suite of computational methods, ranging from quantum chemical calculations to application of conceptually new machine learning models. The scientific objectives are: 1) To determine the chemical composition and stability of FNPs. 2) To understand how FNPs evolve over time via exchange of vapours with the environment. 3) To investigate how FNPs transform as a consequence of chemical reactions occurring at the surface or inside the particles. The research will provide unprecedented insight into the molecular level properties of FNPs. This project will directly supply input parameters (chemical composition, thermodynamics and kinetics) for atmospheric models, which are crucial in order to constrain the large uncertainty in climate predictions caused by small aerosol particles.",

            "objective": "Deep ice cores from ice sheets are unique climate archives. Chemical impurities, deposited initially on the ice sheets, are used to reconstruct the climate of the past. Despite being investigated for several decades, the processes affecting impurities after their deposition, i.e. in the microstructure of ice, still need to be clarified, especially in the oldest parts of the cores. While the quest for the oldest ice in Antarctica has just started, many open questions remain before analysing ice up to 1.5 Myr old. The MESMERISE project aims at investigating the oldest sections of the NGRIP, NEEM, and RECAP ice cores from Greenland, which reach back to the last interglacial, the Eemian, and thus enable important insights into the conditions of a warmer world. In NGRIP ice, annual layers and impurities seem unaffected by relocation, diffusion, and deformational processes. MESMERISE will test this hypothesis by comparing chemical impurities in Holocene and Eemian ice using two state-of-the-art laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) 2D Imaging systems. The recent refinement of the LA-ICP-MS technique by Assist. Prof. Pascal Bohleber at the University of Venice enables the analysis of impurities in ice in ultra-high resolution and two dimensions. It is thus the most promising tool to distinguish annual layers and the localisation of different chemical elements in the microstructure of deep polar ice to investigate post-depositional processes affecting the climate signal. Assist. Prof. Bohleber and Assoc. Prof Anders Svensson, an ice core analysis expert from the Center for Physics of Ice, Climate and Earth at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark, guarantee high-quality research and education at the host institutions. MESMERISE will further build a bridge between the two ERC projects AiCE and Green2Ice, and thus benefits from possibilities such as applying machine learning and modelling to experimental and observational data.",

A key set of information about this change was archived in the snow that fell at that time in Antarctica. At unique locations, that snow is still preserved today in the deepest ice layers\u2013 but does it still contain its original message? \nAiCE will answer this key question specifically using chemical impurity signals which make up a large part of the ice core record about past atmospheric conditions. For this purpose, we take a new approach to study the oldest and highly thinned layers at unprecedented detail. While conventional meltwater analysis delivers 1D cm-resolution signals, we go into 2D by imaging the chemical impurity distribution at micro-metric scale in the solid ice core. This way, we can retrieve crucial information that is inevitably lost by melting: The same ice matrix preserving the climatic record can act on it and ultimately destroy it through various processes, causing impurities to relocate away from their original layer. Hence, the goal is to identify the original layering, by detecting post-depositional change through analyzing highly-dimensional chemical images. \nHowever, human observers have clear limitations in detecting all the important details in such complex visual datasets. This is why AiCE will add deep learning to deep ice: Artificial intelligence (Ai) image analysis will be established through a comprehensive understanding of the chemical image features and their connection to post-depositional processes. With this, we can address the fundamental climate questions through deciphering deep ice \u2013 in Antarctica and elsewhere. Ultimately, AiCE could revolutionize how we interpret the oldest paleoclimate signals in ice cores and other archives.",

These data are particularly relevant to long-term conditions such as diabetes mellitus, where drugs, lifestyle interventions, and digital technologies often work together. To better utilise RWD in diabetes for regulatory decision making, a development of standards, guidance, and an assessment of the efficacy to effectiveness gap is needed.\nREDDIE (Real-World Evidence for Decisions in Diabetes) aims to explore how RWD can complement RCTs to improve efficacy, safety, and value for money of technologies to prevent and treat diabetes. The overall aim of REDDIE is to support the use of RWD in diabetes and health-related research, which will maximise Europe\u2019s scientific expertise and know-how to benefit people with diabetes, resulting in safer, more efficient, and cost-effective interventions.\nWe thus aim to engage with stakeholders such as regulatory and HTA authorities and co-develop evidentiary standards for the collection, assessment, and acceptability of RWD. We will then develop and validate state-of-the art modelling techniques using synthetic data derived from large national registries to better assess outcomes of interventions using RWD. We will use data from four large national registries to elucidate the gap between outcomes in RCTs and RWD studies, and understand the factors that affect this gap.

Findings will inform training activities on good practice examples and will be implemented in existing and emerging guidelines for both health regulatory authorities and health technology assessment (HTA) bodies across Europe. There is urgent need to enable the use and establish the value of the application of RWD across the spectrum of regulatory use cases. The use of RWD is established in regulatory processes such as safety monitoring, but evidentiary value for further use cases, especially in the pre-authorisation and evaluation phase of medicinal products, is rudimentary. The use of RWD in post-authorisation steps is constrained by data variability and by challenges in analysing data from different settings and sources. Thus, the development of new and optimised methods for RWD analyses is essential. Real4Reg addresses the challenges and opportunities of RWD analyses across different health care systems by involving multiple stakeholders to work together in a collaborative approach, also outreaching to already established European initiatives. Our consortium assembles partners with outstanding excellence in the field of RWD analyses, including experts from regulatory agencies/ HTA (BfArM, DKMA, Infarmed), academia (Fraunhofer, UEF, CSC, AU, DZNE) and patient organisations (EUpALS, EIWH).

Despite this progress, the quantum devices we currently have, the so-called noisy, intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, are too imperfect to run textbook quantum algorithms, yet they hold great potential. With their advent, much research has been devoted to finding them a first practical application. Focus on optimization, quantum chemistry and machine learning has been intense, and the developments are closely monitored by governments and industry alike. Variational algorithms in a classical-quantum feedback loop and adiabatic algorithms have been the dominant paradigm. However, important bottle-necks remain that severely maim the performance of NISQ devices and the field yearns for a novel approach.\nFINE-TEA-SQUAD, FIrst NEar-TErm ApplicationS of QUAntum Devices, proposes a radically new vision: to develop a unifying framework that will yield the first practical applications of NISQ devices. The main objectives are (A) to design experimentally-friendly protocols for quantum state preparation circumventing major existing bottlenecks (high number of repetitions, noise-induced barren plateaus...) and characterize broad families of states that can be prepared in a scalable way, (B) to develop a practical certification toolset amenable to near-term devices, with especial focus on the generation of certified randomness from a single NISQ device. The key idea is to use the hardness of many-body physics in a classical verifier-quantum prover interactive protocol. This approach will overcome the existing limitations of current approaches: it will be both easy to prepare and easy to verify (C) to overcome current hardware scalability limitations by combining several NISQ nodes into a small quantum network, and develop the appropriate theoretical framework to efficiently tailor and run quantum algorithms on them.",

Here is a detailed breakdown of the analysis for each criterion:\n\n1. **Minor Objectives or Methods Sharing**: Both projects share the broader aim to harness the potential of NISQ (Noisy, Intermediate-Scale Quantum) devices. However, their specific objectives diverge significantly. FINE-TEA-SQUAD focuses on creating practical applications for NISQ devices in general, emphasizing state preparation and certification, whereas KvasirAccelerator is dedicated to developing a utility-oriented software platform aimed at quantum-centric drug discovery.\n\n2. **Overlapping Goals and Methodologies**: There is some overlap in terms of the broader goals of quantum computing applications, especially in optimization and quantum chemistry. Both projects aim to tackle complex computational problems with quantum algorithms and show a focus on producing practical applications. However, the application domains differ\u2014FINE-TEA-SQUAD is broader and more foundational, while KvasirAccelerator is narrowly focused on drug discovery.\n\n3. **Similarity in Scope, Methodology, and Innovation**: Both projects utilize NISQ technology and variational and adiabatic algorithms in classical-quantum feedback loops, but the scope and primary application areas are distinct. Thus, from a methodological point of view, we can see resemblance but not to the extent of merging requirements.\n\n4. **Alignment in Scope and Methodology for Resource Efficiency**: Merging these projects could provide some benefits in terms of shared knowledge and technology advancements in quantum computing. However, given their specific focus areas (general NISQ application vs. quantum drug discovery software), the gains in resource efficiency might be limited.\n\n5. **Nearly Identical Scope and Methodology**: The two projects are not nearly identical in scope, methodology, or innovation. Each aims to address different practical problems using quantum computing, suggesting that merging them would likely dilute the focus and specialized goals of each project.\n\nIn summary, while there are shared minor objectives and some methodological overlaps, the core purposes of the projects\u2014one being a unifying framework for NISQ device applications and the other a quantum software platform for drug discovery\u2014present enough distinctions to warrant keeping them separate. Merging might offer moderate benefits in knowledge sharing but could also lead to inefficiencies in achieving their respective focused outcomes.",

While much progress has been made at identifying the building blocks of visual processing in brain and cognition, our scientific understanding of visual representations remains fundamentally limited by (1) our ability to capture the complexity and variability of our visual world for determining the dimensions underlying our object representations and (2) the difficulty in disentangling visual and semantic contributions to these representations. COREDIM is an ambitious, interdisciplinary program that aims at overcoming these limitations and provide a detailed, interpretable characterization of the core dimensions underlying visual object representations. To reach this goal, COREDIM capitalizes on extensive, targeted sampling of behavioral and neuroimaging data and cutting-edge artificial intelligence methods that allow the identification of interpretable representational dimensions. Project 1 aims at uncovering the core representational dimensions of objects across ventral visual cortex, using a biologically-inspired neural network model tailored to each individual\u2019s functional neuroanatomy and trained to identify the most informative stimuli.

            "objective": "With the imminent introduction of artificial agents into our digital future, robots will become teammates, companions and counterparts. However, it remains unclear whether people would interact with humanoid robots as social partners or use them as mere tools. NeuroMarkerHRI seeks to identify neural markers of the activation of social cognitive mechanisms with robots based on hemodynamic responses using supervised ML models. This will determine whether the human brain interprets the behavior from a humanoid robot using social (e.g., mirror neuron system, theory of mind) or general domain cognitive mechanisms (e.g., attention, cognitive control). With a hypothesis-driven and stepwise approach, the project will measure hemodynamic responses with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) in brain regions associated with social cognition, theory of mind and perception of mental states during collaborative interactions with humanoid robots. Hemodynamic signal features will be included in the machine learning models to identify predictors of social or general domain cognitive mechanisms. The project's interdisciplinary nature integrates well-documented methods of cognitive neuroscience, advancements in robotics, and state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to thoroughly evaluate the factors that modulate the activation of the social brain exposed to humanoid robots. Outcomes will set standards for future research in human-robot interaction, offer a reliable tool for designers to measure the effect of robot behavior on the users, and boost the development and improvement of efficient human-robot collaboration. The current project contributes to creating a human-centered development of technology and would help towards the digital transition in Europe, allowing to unlock the potential of social, industrial, and commercial human-robot collaboration.",

            "objective": "In parallel to the current developments in the so-called narrow artificial intelligence (AI) realm, there is an urgent demand for more universal, general AI approaches that can operate across a wider spectrum of application domains with varying data characteristics. It is expected that the emerging sustainable AI methods can be efficiently deployed in the edge-cloud continuum on different hardware platforms and computing infrastructure depending on the real-world task scenarios and constraints including the limited energy budget. In response to this growing demand and emerging trends we propose to adopt a brain-like approach to AI system design due to its promising potential for functional flexibility, hardware friendliness as well as energy efficiency among others. To this end, EXTRA-BRAIN is aimed at developing a new generation of AI solutions based on brain-like neural networks that enable us to overcome key limitations of the current state-of-the-art methods, exemplified by deep learning, such as limited cross-task generalisation and extrapolation to novel domains (bounded reliability), excessive dependence on costly annotated data as well as extensive training and validation processes with heavy demand for compute resources at high energy cost, to name a few. The core brain-like neural network design in our approach derives from the accumulated computational neuroscience insights into the brain's working principles of information processing, key learning schemes and neuroanatomical structures that underlie the brain's perceptual/cognitive phenomena and its functional flexibility. Furthermore, these novel models are supported by data optimisation pipelines, which improve data quality, security and reduce the costs of assembling suitable training data, and an explainability framework to empower the human user. The proposed EXTRA-BRAIN framework will be examined in a diverse set of use cases with different hardware demands in the edge-cloud continuum.",

National population-based cancer screening programmes in Europe currently implement 3 standard imaging modalities: mammography, ultrasound and MRI. The downsides of these screening methods include ionising radiation, high costs and high false positive rates in screening results.\nOur multidisciplinary consortium of 16 partners from 10 countries aims to contribute to EU\u2019s Mission on Cancer and Beating Cancer Plan by drastically improving the prevention, diagnosis and monitoring of breast cancer while reducing the burden on women and female patients and their families, health care professionals and others who are directly or indirectly affected by breast cancer.\nThermoBreast proposes a new solution for accurate, harmless and non-contact screening, equally applicable for all age groups and breast densities and capable of detecting pre-cancerous states. This risk-free screening technology, recently patented by the project coordinator ThermoMind LTD, can detect vascular anomalies and asymmetry, caused by cancerous growth. It combines innovative screening through multiple sensitive infrared sensors with advanced AI analysis of temporal dynamic thermal patterns. Through its patient-centred integrated diagnostics approach, this project converges intelligent computer vision, blood vessel extraction and tissue analysis with advanced information technology to deliver a medical class 1 device that will be validated in an international multicentre clinical study. To enhance stakeholder participation, ThermoBreast involves end users, SSH experts and a patient organisation in the co-creation of the new screening solution and assesses its health and socio-economic benefits as well as its cost effectiveness.

The project builds on the repositories, tools and results of five EU-funded projects from the AI for Health Imaging (AI4HI) Network, including a large multi-centre cancer imaging dataset on NAC treatment in breast cancer. To test applicability as well as transferability, the validation with take place in eight clinical centres from three high-income EU countries (Sweden, Austria, Spain), two emerging EU countries (Poland, Croatia), and three countries from South America (Argentina), North Africa (Egypt) and Eurasia (Turkey). \n\nRadioVal will develop a comprehensive and standardised methodological framework for multi-faceted radiomics evaluation based on the FUTURE-AI Guidelines, to assess Fairness, Universality, Traceability, Usability, Robustness and Explainability.

This necessarily creates information-transmission bottlenecks at the interface between quantum and classical realms. These bottlenecks create scalability issues that prevent us from using existing architectures to the best of their capabilities and may even impair our ability to further scale up system sizes.\n\nIn this project, we adopt a unifying framework that takes into account all computing resources (quantum and classical). We develop quantum-to-classical converters to overcome information-transmission bottlenecks. Dubbed shadows, they leverage randomization, as well as quantum-enhanced readout strategies to obtain a succinct classical description of an underlying quantum system that can then be used to efficiently predict many features at once. The shadow paradigm is compatible with near-term quantum hardware and utilizes genuine quantum effects that do not have a classical counterpart. Building on these ideas, we also establish rigorous synergies between quantum experiments and classical machine learning. Shadow learning protocols use shadows to succinctly represent training data obtained from actual quantum experiments. A classical training stage then enables data-driven learning of genuine quantum phenomena. Finally, we develop new tools to ensure reliable execution on current quantum hardware, thus bridging the gap between theory and experiment.\n\nMy interdisciplinary skill set combines methods from modern computer science with quantum information and has already led to numerous high-impact contributions (e.g. 1 Nature Physics with more than 350 citations and 2 Science publications).

As our society is facing a dramatic increase in inequalities and intersectional discrimination, we need to prevent AI systems to amplify this phenomenon but rather mitigate it. To trust these systems, domain experts and stakeholders need to trust the decisions.\nFairness stands as one of the main principles of Trustworthy AI promoted at EU level. How these principles, in particular fairness, translate into technical, functional social, and lawful requirements in the AI system design is still an open question. Similarly we don\u2019t know how to test if a system is compliant with these principles and repair it in case it is not.\nAEQUITAS proposes the design of a controlled experimentation environment for developers and users to create controlled experiments for\n- assessing the bias in AI systems, e.g., identifying potential causes of bias in data, algorithms, and interpretation of results,\n- providing, when possible, effective methods and engineering guidelines to repair, remove, and mitigate bias,\n- provide fairness-by-design guidelines, methodologies, and software engineering techniques to design new bias-free systems\nThe experimentation environment generates synthetic data sets with different features influencing fairness for a test in laboratories. Real use cases in health care, human resources and social disadvantaged group challenges further test the experimentation platform showcasing the effectiveness of the solution proposed. The experimentation playground will be integrated on the AI-on-demand platform to boost its uptake, but a stand-alone release will enable on-premise privacy-preserving test of AI-systems fairness.\nAEQUITAS relies on a strong consortium featuring AI experts, domain experts in the use case sectors as well as social scientists and associations defending rights of minorities and discriminated groups.",

We will build an open, accessible, community-driven repository of FAIR pre-trained AI models and develop services to deliver these models to life scientists, including those without substantial computational expertise. Our direct support and ample training activities will prepare life scientists for responsible use of AI methods, while contributor services and open standards will drive community contributions of new models and interoperability between analysis tools.

The combination of advanced experimental structural biology, machine learning algorithms and molecular simulations has put the fully quantitative description of how the structure and interactions of folded proteins are defined by their amino acid sequence within close reach. \nThis leaves us with a final frontier in protein science, namely to achieve a similar level of understanding for intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). The energy landscapes of IDPs often comprise a multitude of nearly isoenergetic states, that include assembled forms, such as amyloid fibrils and liquid condensate droplets.\nMuch effort has been spent in order to achieve an understanding of the molecular grammar of IDP assembly and condensation, i.e. how amino acid sequence defines both kinetics and thermodynamics of these processes. Current state of the art is to evaluate a few dozens of sequence perturbations quantitatively in vitro.\nIn EMMA, I propose to develop a fundamentally new approach that will ultimately allow to improve on current methods by more than 8 orders of magnitude. This ground-breaking improvement will be achieved by exploiting the power of mRNA display, in which the biophysical behavior of each individual sequence within large libraries of protein-mRNA constructs can be evaluated in a \"one pot\" reaction. We will combine quantitative screening of the energetics of liquid condensate droplet formation of up to 10^10 sequences by mRNA display with a multiparametric biophysical toolbox that allows the key thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of binding and assembly to be evaluated for thousands of selected sequence variants.\nEMMA will transform our ability to probe the mechanisms and interrelationships of the interactions and assembly processes that define IDP function and disease-related malfunction.",

IDPs possess the unique ability to sample ensembles of different three dimensional conformations, leading to transition pathways that have a crucial role in various unique molecular functions. However, despite their importance, our understanding of IDPs is limited due to the challenges of studying such dynamic and large molecular systems experimentally, relegating their characterization to computational methods.\nAlthough the recent breakthrough in artificial intelligence (AI)-based protein structure prediction methods has raised the awareness of the scientific community about the IDR prevalence in proteomes (up to 50% of residues in higher organisms), their ability to predict reliable IDP ensembles and explain their function remains completely unexplored.\nBuilding upon the IDPfun Consortium and in collaboration with the ELIXIR IDP Community and the ML4NGP COST Action, the proposed IDPfun2 Consortium brings together 7 European and 5 Argentinian leading institutions with complementary expertise in data management, machine learning and structural biology. IDPfun2 will combine state-of-the-art AI-based computational technology and novel data to advance the characterization of IDPs and their molecular behaviour also taking into account alternative molecular and evolutionary contexts. \nThe Consortium will establish new standards and formats to better grasp the complexity of IDPs and provide training ground for a new generation of scientists.

WIth the aim to enhance availability and coverage and to improve sensing performance, will leverage Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) making use of the distributed nature of the access points and availability of multiple antennas. An optimization of distributed signal processing and resource allocation schemes tailored for RIS-assisted CF network architecture is proposed. This framework will make use of new PHY technologies to increase the cooperation among access points and their inherent capabilities to improve the precision/accuracy of the sensing capabilities. Sensing information stemming from these technologies will be pushed to the O-RAN framweork for optimization purposes using the Radio Intelligent Controllers (RICs). A total of three Proof-of-Concept demonstrations will be showcased, which encompass the proposed objectives of the project in a single infrastructure.",

In that sense, cell-free massive MIMO, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), and edge intelligence are anticipated to be key technologies in the 6G era. \n\nDIRACFEC is a 24-months research project that thus concentrates on the Design of Intelligent RIS-Aided Cell-Free networks for Energy-efficient Coexistence between evolved eMBB (eMBB+) and evolved mMTC (mMTC+). More specifically, considering user-centric architectures and distributed multiple antenna deployments, we will present a set of multiple access schemes, edge intelligence techniques, and transmission strategies that optimize the energy efficiency in a heterogeneous service environment, aiming at the coexistence of eMBB+ and mMTC+ services. We will conceive mathematical frameworks to model dense networks where several RISs are controlled by multiple antenna access points. Then, to boost the ultimate performance, we will design the aforementioned approaches for different types of data traffic under the assumption of imperfect channel knowledge. These solutions will be evaluated using numerical and industry level system-level simulations in practical setups.\n\nThe project will be carried out by the researcher at the University of Cassino and Lazio Meridionale (Italy), under the supervision of\nProf. Stefano Buzzi. Furthermore, Nokia Bell Labs (France) will host the researcher for a six-months secondment\naimed at validation of the developed solutions on industry level system simulators.

However, the implementation of safe and reliable control software remains a critical challenge for car manufacturers before fully autonomous vehicles become a reality. The current lack of reliability in autonomous vehicle software is mainly attributed to the absence of formal correctness. Design requirements are not expressed in a formal language, leading to ambiguity and false implementations. Furthermore, human factors from engineers to developers increase the likelihood of errors, and testing scenarios are limited, leaving many edge cases untested. Immature control software leading to accidents undermines public trust in autonomous vehicles and impedes further development. We propose leveraging our ongoing ERC project AutoCPS research to create robust, reliable, and formally correct automotive control software. CertiCar proposes a software development framework that automates control software generation and guarantees its robustness and reliability. A reliable advanced collision avoidance system (ACAS) is a fundamental requirement for future autonomous vehicles, significantly reducing the number of accidents, injuries, and fatalities. CertiCar's PoC project aims to provide a correct-by-design ACAS with guaranteed correctness, reducing testing time by several orders of magnitude for car companies, and represents an initial step toward a complete software stack for a certifiable autonomous car.",

It is expected that the emerging sustainable AI methods can be efficiently deployed in the edge-cloud continuum on different hardware platforms and computing infrastructure depending on the real-world task scenarios and constraints including the limited energy budget. In response to this growing demand and emerging trends we propose to adopt a brain-like approach to AI system design due to its promising potential for functional flexibility, hardware friendliness as well as energy efficiency among others. To this end, EXTRA-BRAIN is aimed at developing a new generation of AI solutions based on brain-like neural networks that enable us to overcome key limitations of the current state-of-the-art methods, exemplified by deep learning, such as limited cross-task generalisation and extrapolation to novel domains (bounded reliability), excessive dependence on costly annotated data as well as extensive training and validation processes with heavy demand for compute resources at high energy cost, to name a few. The core brain-like neural network design in our approach derives from the accumulated computational neuroscience insights into the brain's working principles of information processing, key learning schemes and neuroanatomical structures that underlie the brain's perceptual/cognitive phenomena and its functional flexibility. Furthermore, these novel models are supported by data optimisation pipelines, which improve data quality, security and reduce the costs of assembling suitable training data, and an explainability framework to empower the human user. The proposed EXTRA-BRAIN framework will be examined in a diverse set of use cases with different hardware demands in the edge-cloud continuum.",

Most importantly, 6G is expected to trigger a total rethink of network architecture design, which builds on the key idea of new stakeholders entering into the value chain of future networks. The SUNRISE-6G approach is inspired by the \"network of networks\" concept of 6G Networks, aiming to integrate all private and public infrastructures under a massively scalable internet-like architecture. SUNRISE-6G similarly aspires to create a federation of 6G test infrastructures in a pan-european facility that will support converged Testing as a Service (TaaS) workflows and tools, a unified catalogue of 6G enablers publicly accessible by experimenters, and cross-domain vertical application onboarding. Experimentation and vertical application onboarding are offered via a Tenant Web Portal, that acts as a single-entry point to the facility, serving end users (e.g., experimenters) and tenants (e.g., vertical developers, infrastructure owners, 6G component manufactures). The project execution is based on 4 pillars, delivering: (a) the Implementation of new 6G enablers, complementary to existing ones being developed in SNS Phase 1 projects, (b) A truly scalable and 3GPP compliant Federation solution that provides access to heterogeneous resources and devices from all Europe, (c) A Federated AI plane aligned with AIaaS and MLOPS paradigms, which promotes a collaborative approach to AI research which benefits immensely from scaling-up datasets and models and (d) a commonly adopted Experimentation Plane, which offers common workflows to experimenters.",

Developing sustainable, efficient and safe hydrogen storage technologies has, however, proved challenging. MOST-H2, in full alignment with the requirements of HORIZON-CL4-2021-RESILIENCE-01-17, proposes an integrated multiscale lab-to-tank approach to develop, validate and demonstrate innovative, low cost cryo-adsorptive hydrogen storage, using monolithic Metal-Organic Framework (MOF) adsorbents, with an optimal combination of volumetric and gravimetric capacity, but also a small environmental footprint. Advanced synthetic strategies and sophisticated computational techniques, including molecular simulation and machine learning, will be combined in a cyclic materials development approach, to deliver new high performance, sustainable-by-design MOF adsorbents. The main aim is to computationally design, then synthesise and validate experimentally, ultra porous MOFs with usable storage capacities above 10 wt% and 50 g/L on a materials basis, at an operating pressure below 100 bar. This represents an essential step towards more efficient, intrinsically safer and cost effective storage solutions, compared to conventional hydrogen storage technologies. An important part of the project will be devoted to developing and upscaling monolithic forms of optimal MOF materials to allow easy integration into a cryo-adsorption storage tank, specifically designed for this purpose, which will be tested in a TRL 5 environment. The outcomes, coupled with full life cycle analysis and techno-economic assessment of MOST-H2 technology, with a view to selected end uses (rail and road applications), will form the basis for elaborating future market penetration plans through a solid horizontal dissemination and exploitation strategy.",

The major challenge in the hydrogen economy is related to the production of hydrogen from water and the generation of energy by the oxidation of hydrogen into water. In this regard, the main objective of the project High-throughput Discovery of Catalysts for the Hydrogen Economy through Machine Learning (HighHydrogenML) is to develop a high-throughput strategy based on first principles calculations and artificial intelligence tools to discover intermetallic compounds whose catalytic activity can be tuned to reach an optimum catalytic performance for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) and Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR) by means of elastic strain engineering. The successful completion of these objectives will provide unique information for experimental synthesis of intermetallic compounds with high catalytic activity for the HER and ORR and could, therefore, open a new avenue for a feasible and efficient hydrogen economy. Moreover, the strategies and tools developed in this project can be applied later to many other catalytic processes of large industrial and/or environmental interest. To achieve these goals, the project HighHydrogenML involves multidisciplinary expertise in solid state physics, materials science, machine learning, and chemistry that will be coupled in a seamless framework to exploit the high predictive power of ab initio calculations in conjunction with the efficiency of ML models.  Therefore, this project brings together a researcher with expertise in atomistic and materials modelling within a broad range of different computational chemistry methods and artificial intelligence techniques, a world-recognized supervisor in the area of multiscale modelling of materials, and a research institute with a record of excellence, technology transfer, and top-level training in Materials Science and Engineering.",

THOR concentrates on creating a comprehensive Digital Twin for battery testing purposes across multiple applications and chemistries, aiming to reduce physical testing and align with the complete battery value chain. ULICBat, on the other hand, focuses specifically on innovative charging control strategies informed by user behavior to prolong battery life and improve efficiency in the context of electric vehicles. While there is a shared overarching goal and some methodological overlap, the specific objectives, use cases, and targeted outcomes differ enough to justify keeping them separate. Merging the projects might result in marginal resource efficiency gains but could dilute the distinct, application-specific innovations each project aims to achieve independently.",

The use cases are focused on critical challenges and tasks of network operators, considering strategic long-term goals, such as decarbonisation, digitalisation, and resilience to disturbances, and are formulated in a unified sequential decision problem where many AI and non-AI algorithms can be applied and benchmarked.",

To avoid a conflict between sustainability and economic competitiveness and to allow the European economy to leverage AI for its leadership in a climate friendly way, new technologies to reduce the energy requirements of all parts of AI system are needed. A key problem is the fact that tools (e.g. PyTorch) and methods that currently drive the rapid spread and democratization of AI prioritize performance and functionality while paying little attention to the CO2 footprint. As a consequence, we see rapid growth in AI applications, but not much so in AI applications that are optimized for low power and sustainability. To change that we aim to develop an interactive design framework and associated models, methods and tools that will foster energy efficiency throughout the whole life-cycle of ML applications: from the design and exploration phase that includes exploratory iterations of training, testing and optimizing different system versions through the final training of the production systems (which often involves huge amounts of data, computation and epochs) and (where appropriate) continuous online re-training during deployment for the inference process. The framework will optimize the ML solutions based on the application tasks, across levels from hardware to model architecture. AI developers from all experience levels will be able to make use of the framework through its emphasis on human-centric interactive transparent design and functional knowledge cores, instead of the common blackbox and fully automated optimization approaches in AutoML.  The framework will be made available on the AI4EU platform and disseminated through close collaboration with initiatives such as the ICT 48 networks.

However, as machine learning models grow in capacity, they become increasingly \u2018black box\u2019, and it becomes harder for humans to reason about the patterns discovered by the machine. A root cause of this difficulty is that most machine learning models can express the same pattern in infinitely many, equally good, ways within their internal representations of the world. This is known as an identifiability problem.\n\nToday we lack a general solution to identifiability problems, and either give up on understanding the patterns discovered by the machine or reduce model complexity to lessen the problem. The latter also reduces the fidelity and applicability of the model. NoKnow rephrase the question of identifiability to be concerned with tasks solved by the representation rather than the representation itself. Using tools from differential geometry and Bayesian inference, we develop the theoretical tools to ensure that tasks solved in the representation have an identifiable outcome even if the representations themselves are not identifiable.\n\nTo turn theory into practice, we develop state-of-the-art algorithms for assessing the uncertainty of learned representations in order to indirectly estimate the topology of the representation manifold. We further develop novel, high-fidelity predictive models that have identifiable outcomes when trained on learned representations.\n\nNoKnow provides the fundamental tools needed to engage with learned representations to guarantee identifiable outcomes.

Notably, precision medicine in BC is still in its infancy and is becoming even more critical with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), a standard of care treatment protocol in HER2-positive (HER2+) and triple negative (TN) subtypes. Recently, the use of digital diagnostics with AI is gaining momentum since it shows great promise towards accelerating personalized BC patients\u2019 pre- and post-NAC predictions. While AI paves the way to next generation diagnostics, this has yet from been translated as a) it mostly operates in single data modalities that fail to capture the complex disease alterations, b) integrated AI usually suffers from data incompleteness usually leading to models trained with limited data that fail to generalize to new patients and/or that are not able to integrate partially observed multimodal information from the whole population.

ThermoBreast's scope includes a broad range of breast cancer screening and involves various stakeholders, while GRANITE zeroes in on precision medicine and the challenges of multi-modal data in AI for neoadjuvant chemotherapy contexts.

This concept is to intertwine modern AI concepts with strategies from the application field, a strategy where we claim that we can contribute substantially to a novel and promising research field. \n\nParticle physics is a formidable basis for such developments as there are no critical, personal data, data can be easily generated; and we have a good understanding of the underlying models and the ground truth. Yet, particle physics has challenges such as detailed questions of new physics and extremely high precision of the results. We identified three main fields where this project will contribute by solving 1) highly ill-posed inverse problems using physics models, 2) handling uncertainties, rare events and give reliable error bounds, and finally, 3) to be able to give explanations of the machine learning results in terms of physics ontologies and models. \n\nThis highly challenging research agenda is tackled by 9 internationally recognized and leading researchers from both physics and computer science, from 5 universities in 5 European countries, all being member of the 4EU+ Alliance of European Universities.

Photovoltaic (PV) technology provides a clean, safe, and affordable renewable source of energy. New photovoltaic materials with high power conversion efficiencies are needed to meet the European Green Deal's 2050 targets and to ensure the large-scale deployment of solar cells. An encouraging material class are perovskites, but as they suffer from toxicity and stability problems, this impedes their commercial viability. One promising alternative are mixed-metal chalcohalides (PIMMCHs), which have the potential to overcome these known problems with perovskites and still exhibit good optoelectronic properties, thus making them of interest for PV applications. However this promising class of materials remains widely unexplored. The aim of this project (EXT-PIMMCH) is to expand the material space of PIMMCH compounds and our understanding of this material class. I will explore I) binary and II) ternary PIMMCH alloys in order to identify promising PIMMCH alloys which are suitable for indoor and outdoor PV applications. For this purpose I will use a combination of density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning to accelerate the material exploration. Finally I will identify a few dozen promising PIMMCH alloys for indoor and/or outdoor PV applications to facilitate further experimental research. Also I will study III) the influence of defects such as vacancies, interstitials and antisites on PIMMCH materials using DFT, which can be used to determine the defect tolerance/intolerance of PIMMCH materials. A profound understanding of defects in PIMMCH materials is essential, because they could have a significant effect on the performance of PV applications. Overall EXT-PIMMCH will facilitate the development of efficient, stable and non-toxic PSCs, thus accelerating large-scale commercial adoption of PSCs.",

However, the community still struggles with the scaling and reproducibility when printing perovskite thin-film absorber layers from solution due to the complex perovskite formation process that is susceptible to a variety of environment and process parameters.\nThis project proposes a novel interface between perovskite solution printing and algorithmic optimization and control theory by equipping a roll-to-roll perovskite printing line with in situ characterization, computational data processing and automatically adjustable process parameters. The characterization is given by point-probe reflection/absorption as well as luminescence imaging measurements. Feedback for control is calculated in real-time using simple control algorithms, at first, and progressing in complexity toward the employment of deep reinforcement learning (DRL), later on. The images are analyzed offline using convolutional neural networks for optimizing absorption/reflection set points for the above-described feedback control.\nThe proposal has two main goals: 1) Boosting the optimization of perovskite solution printing by effectively balancing exploration and exploitation of the large parameter space 2) demonstrating enhanced process control of certain system states to achieve higher process reproducibility and resilience in perovskite printing. These goals are complementary in a sense that control is exceeded on rapidly accessible parameters while optimization is performed with slowly accessible parameters.\nIn conclusion, this proposal presents a fundamental and concise new methodology of addressing reproducibility and scalability in perovskite solution printing that could be used for printing of functional thin-film, as well, highlighting its generality.",

It is expected that the emerging sustainable AI methods can be efficiently deployed in the edge-cloud continuum on different hardware platforms and computing infrastructure depending on the real-world task scenarios and constraints including the limited energy budget. In response to this growing demand and emerging trends we propose to adopt a brain-like approach to AI system design due to its promising potential for functional flexibility, hardware friendliness as well as energy efficiency among others. To this end, EXTRA-BRAIN is aimed at developing a new generation of AI solutions based on brain-like neural networks that enable us to overcome key limitations of the current state-of-the-art methods, exemplified by deep learning, such as limited cross-task generalisation and extrapolation to novel domains (bounded reliability), excessive dependence on costly annotated data as well as extensive training and validation processes with heavy demand for compute resources at high energy cost, to name a few. The core brain-like neural network design in our approach derives from the accumulated computational neuroscience insights into the brain's working principles of information processing, key learning schemes and neuroanatomical structures that underlie the brain's perceptual/cognitive phenomena and its functional flexibility. Furthermore, these novel models are supported by data optimisation pipelines, which improve data quality, security and reduce the costs of assembling suitable training data, and an explainability framework to empower the human user. The proposed EXTRA-BRAIN framework will be examined in a diverse set of use cases with different hardware demands in the edge-cloud continuum.",

While machine learning has unlocked new potentials for robot autonomy, as robots venture into the real world, physical interactions with the surrounding environment pose additional challenges. One typical challenge in practical applications is providing safety guarantees in robot decision-making. Much of the safe robot decision-making literature today focuses on explicit safety constraints defined in the robot state and input space. However, in practical applications, robots are often required to infer semantics-grounded safe actions from perception input. While recent machine learning techniques are increasingly capable of distilling semantic information from perception, translating the semantic understanding to explicit safety constraints is non-trivial. In this proposed project, we aim to close the perception-action loop and develop mathematical foundations and algorithmic tools that enable robots to make intelligent and semantically safe decisions.",

Both projects emphasize the need for improved cognitive capabilities in robots and propose advanced methodologies involving machine learning and AI. However, there are distinct elements that set them apart, warranting a medium score based on how they satisfy each of the evaluated criteria. Below is the breakdown of the scoring based on the criteria provided:\n\n1. Minor objectives/methods shared: Both projects aim to enhance the decision-making capabilities of robots in human-centered environments. While PRIMI focuses on mental imagery and cognitive functions to facilitate human-like interaction, SSDM is oriented towards semantic safety in robot decision-making. This earns them 1 point.\n\n2. Overlapping goals/methodologies/innovations with distinct elements: Both projects involve machine learning and AI techniques, with PRIMI emphasizing neuromorphic engineering and humanoid robotics, while SSDM concentrates on translating semantic understanding to explicit safety constraints. This earns another point for sharing methodologies but differing in applications and specifics.\n\n3. Key similarities in scope/methodology/innovation but distinctions remain: PRIMI and SSDM both aspire to improve robots' interaction abilities and decision-making processes, leveraging advanced AI techniques. However, PRIMI's broader scope includes higher-cognition abilities and event-driven computing, while SSDM strictly focuses on semantic safety. These distinctions suggest that merging could provide moderate benefits, granting a third point.\n\n4. Close alignment in scope/methodology/innovation, improved resource efficiency: While there are overlaps in the goals and methodologies, the detailed objectives and approaches show that merging would enhance resource use only moderately. They address some different high-level problems, indicating only partial benefits in combining. Hence, no fourth point is awarded.\n\n5. Nearly identical in scope/methodology/innovation, significant optimization from merging: The projects are not nearly identical in their focus and advanced methods, so they do not score the fifth point as merging them would not be significantly optimizing.\n\nTherefore, combining these projects could yield some research efficiency improvements and a broader impact. However, due to their distinct focal points in cognitive capabilities and semantic safety, they also stand to benefit from remaining independent to fully address their specialized objectives.",

These huge models, often engineered by large corporations benefiting from huge computational resources, typically require learning a billion or more of parameters. They have proven to be very effective in solving prediction tasks in computer vision, natural language processing, and computational biology, for example, but they mostly remain black boxes that are hard to interpret, computationally demanding, and not robust to small data perturbations.\nWith a strong emphasis on visual modeling, the grand challenge of APHELEIA is to develop a new generation of machine learning models that are more robust, interpretable, and efficient, and do not require massive amounts of data to produce accurate predictions. To achieve this objective, we will foster new interactions between classical signal processing, statistics, optimization, and modern deep learning. Our goal is to reduce the need for massive data by enabling scientists and engineers to design trainable machine learning models that directly encode a priori knowledge of the task semantics and data formation process, while automatically prefering simple and stable solutions over complex ones. These models will be built on solid theoretical foundations with convergence and robustness guarantees, which are important to make real-life trustworthy predictions in the wild. We will implement these ideas in an open-source software toolbox readily applicable to visual recognition and inverse imaging problems, which will also handle other modalities. This will stimulate interdisciplinary collaborations, with the potential to be a game changer in the way scientists and engineers design machine learning problems.",

However, most of the machines used are black boxes, and the causal relation between inputs and outputs is often impossible to extract. Nonetheless, a critical aspect when dealing with physical systems is not only to make correct predictions, but to understand the physical laws which underlie these assessments. Recently, an increasing number of works aim at developing interpretable ML methods, from which such hidden laws can be extracted. However, their application to physics has been often limited to supervised and unsupervised learning approaches.\nThe aim of this project is: 1) construct an interpretable reinforcement learning method; 2) extract hidden rules and features in timely and paramount problems in physics. The method combines three well-established concepts of ML: projective simulation, graph neural networks (GNN) and hidden variable disentanglement. PS provides interpretable RL agents that can be trained for a variety of tasks, from the construction of quantum experiments, via skill acquisition in robotics, to the modelling of honeybee colonies. By enhancing their learning power and interpretability with GNNs and variable disentanglement, we will extract the hidden features of the systems the RL agents have interacted with and ultimately, the physical laws governing them. In particular, we will tackle problems in the field of condensed matter, where particles diffuse either passively or actively, to reach a target state. Moreover, we will consider ensembles of RL agents, so as to analyze not only the physical properties of the systems, but also their interactions and communication dynamics in the quest of a common target.\nThe originality of the proposal is directly related to: 1) the methods that will be developed; 2) the systems of study; 3) most importantly, the information we will access and discover with the interpretable RL agents.",

To avoid a conflict between sustainability and economic competitiveness and to allow the European economy to leverage AI for its leadership in a climate friendly way, new technologies to reduce the energy requirements of all parts of AI system are needed. A key problem is the fact that tools (e.g. PyTorch) and methods that currently drive the rapid spread and democratization of AI prioritize performance and functionality while paying little attention to the CO2 footprint. As a consequence, we see rapid growth in AI applications, but not much so in AI applications that are optimized for low power and sustainability. To change that we aim to develop an interactive design framework and associated models, methods and tools that will foster energy efficiency throughout the whole life-cycle of ML applications: from the design and exploration phase that includes exploratory iterations of training, testing and optimizing different system versions through the final training of the production systems (which often involves huge amounts of data, computation and epochs) and (where appropriate) continuous online re-training during deployment for the inference process. The framework will optimize the ML solutions based on the application tasks, across levels from hardware to model architecture. AI developers from all experience levels will be able to make use of the framework through its emphasis on human-centric interactive transparent design and functional knowledge cores, instead of the common blackbox and fully automated optimization approaches in AutoML.

The idea is to use a series of low-resolution frames from a moving camera, rather than using a single high-resolution image. This novel algorithm, termed here DRVis, can be implemented in software or hardware. Unlike existing solutions that use multiple frames to reconstruct a high resolution image from low resolution ones, DRVis does not need to learn all the particularities needed for reconstruction; instead, it focuses on extracting the necessary features per the given task. The goals of the PoC project are to scale up and diversify our current software system, implement the system in hardware and demonstrate its performance in field conditions and develop the IPR strategy and explore the commercialization potential of our solution.

The project execution is based on 4 pillars, delivering: (a) the Implementation of new 6G enablers, complementary to existing ones being developed in SNS Phase 1 projects, (b) A truly scalable and 3GPP compliant Federation solution that provides access to heterogeneous resources and devices from all Europe, (c) A Federated AI plane aligned with AIaaS and MLOPS paradigms, which promotes a collaborative approach to AI research which benefits immensely from scaling-up datasets and models and (d) a commonly adopted Experimentation Plane, which offers common workflows to experimenters.",

The new challenging 6G KPI, the renewed need for sustainable and green networks, and the introduction of AI and sensing, evinces the necessity of incorporating new technologies and of designing novel solutions. In that sense, cell-free massive MIMO, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), and edge intelligence are anticipated to be key technologies in the 6G era. \n\nDIRACFEC is a 24-months research project that thus concentrates on the Design of Intelligent RIS-Aided Cell-Free networks for Energy-efficient Coexistence between evolved eMBB (eMBB+) and evolved mMTC (mMTC+). More specifically, considering user-centric architectures and distributed multiple antenna deployments, we will present a set of multiple access schemes, edge intelligence techniques, and transmission strategies that optimize the energy efficiency in a heterogeneous service environment, aiming at the coexistence of eMBB+ and mMTC+ services. We will conceive mathematical frameworks to model dense networks where several RISs are controlled by multiple antenna access points. Then, to boost the ultimate performance, we will design the aforementioned approaches for different types of data traffic under the assumption of imperfect channel knowledge. These solutions will be evaluated using numerical and industry level system-level simulations in practical setups.\n\nThe project will be carried out by the researcher at the University of Cassino and Lazio Meridionale (Italy), under the supervision of\nProf. Stefano Buzzi. Furthermore, Nokia Bell Labs (France) will host the researcher for a six-months secondment\naimed at validation of the developed solutions on industry level system simulators.

An intelligent and digitized society will be ubiquitous, enabled by increased advances in nanoelectronics. Key drivers will be sensors interfacing with the physical world and taking appropriate action in a timely manner while operating with energy efficiency and flexibility to adapt. The vast majority of sensors receive analog inputs from the real world and generate analog signals to be processed. However, digitizing these signals not only creates enormous amount of raw data but also require a lot of memory and high-power consumption. As the number of sensor-based IoTs grows, bandwidth limitations make it difficult to send everything back to a cloud rapidly enough for real-time processing and decision-making, especially for delay-sensitive applications such as driverless vehicles, robotics, or industrial manufacturing. \nIn this context, PHASTRAC proposes to develop a novel analog-to-information neuromorphic computing paradigm based on oscillatory neural networks (ONNs). We propose a first-of-its-kind and novel analog ONN computing architecture to seamlessly interface with sensors and process their analog data without any analog-to-digital conversion. ONNs are biologically inspired neuromorphic computing architecture, where neuron oscillatory behavior will be developed by innovative phase change VO2 material coupled with synapses to be developed by bilayer Mo/HfO2 RRAM devices. PHASTRAC will address key issues 1) novel devices for implementing ONN architecture, 2) novel ONN architecture to allow analog sensor data processing, and 3) processing the data efficiently to take appropriate action. This \"sensing-to-action\" computing approach based on ONN technology will allow energy efficiency improvement 100x-1000x and establish a novel analog computing paradigm for improved future human-machine interactions.",

One type of AI is Natural Language Processing (NLP) based tools that can analyze text to make inferences or decisions. A recent Sage study found that 24% of companies used AI for hiring purposes. In an employment context, this can involve analyzing text created by an employee or recruitment candidate in order to assist management in deciding to invite a candidate for an interview, to training and employee engagement, or to monitor for infractions that could lead to disciplinary proceedings. However, the models that NLP-based systems are based on are biased. Additionally, it has been shown that bias in an underlying AI model is reproduced in applications based on that model). This can lead to biased decisions that run contrary to the goals of the European Pillar of Social Rights in relationship to work and employment, specifically Pillar 2 (Gender Equality), Pillar 3 (Equal Opportunity), Pillar 5 (Secure and Adaptable Employment) and the United Nations\u2019 (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), specifically SDG 5 (Gender Equality), SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth). It is therefore necessary to identify and mitigate biases that occur in applications used in a Human Resources Management (HRM) context. Addressing such concerns in an employment context is especially relevant, as most existing European studies on employment discrimination have indeed found that discrimination exists, both when considering individual diversity criteria and multiple criteria in intersectional analyses. In order to investigate and mitigate these biases, we apply this \"BIAS\"-project, for mitigating diversity biases of AI in the labor market. The chief technical objective of BIAS is the development of a proof-of-concept for an innovative technology based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Case Based Reasoning (CBR) for use in an HR recruitment use case.",

In the criminal procedural field, AI is enhancing the efficiency of law enforcement authorities and criminal justice systems in both preventing and prosecuting crimes, through the streamlining of tasks like data analysis, evidence assessment, and crime prediction. Despite this accelerating trend, a conspicuous gap persists due to the lack of a clear and comprehensive legal framework at both national and supranational levels. An additional factor hindering a responsible and beneficial implementation of AI in the criminal procedural sector is that some technical characteristics of the AI prototypes developed so far (e.g. opacity) interfere with some criminal procedural principles and standards. The lack of dialogue between legal scholarship and scientific community prevents the identification of suitable technical solutions. Given this scenario, managing the legal and ethical implications of AI in the criminal justice system proves to be a prohibitive challenge. The aim of FUTURE is twofold: to support national legislators across the EU in the regulation of artificial intelligence in criminal procedure, while fostering a harmonized approach to the subject; to bridge the gap between the technical and the legal community, ensuring the compliance of AI systems implemented in the criminal procedural field with its principles and safeguards. To achieve these objectives, FUTURE will firstly employ the legal comparison method in a groundbreaking manner: it will be applied on a comprehensive legal and empirical data set, covering all EU Member States\u2019 jurisdictions. Secondly, it will bridge the expertise of legal and computer science professionals, giving them the first tangible chance to investigate the technical issues obstructing the use of AI in criminal proceedings and to assess the feasibility of technical solutions.",

As a result, the efficacy of standard cancer therapies varies, and while some patients respond to a particular treatment, other patients do not gain any benefit. Consequently, crucial in cancer therapy is the prediction of a patient\u2019s response to treatment. Failure of standard therapies has led to the introduction of a new era of personalized, patient-specific treatments, which are based on the identification of biomarkers that characterize the state of a particular tumor. Many solid tumors (e.g., breast cancers and sarcomas) stiffen as they grow in a host\u2019s normal tissue. Tumor stiffening is a known factor leading to compromised efficacy of therapeutics. Recently, it has been demonstrated by our team and co-workers that repurposing of common drugs with anti-fibrotic properties, known as \"mechanotherapeutics\", target tumor stiffness and enhance therapy. Here, we aim to harness the power of deep learning (DL) methods in order to develop a robust biomarker based on ultrasound shear wave elastography (SWE). This biomarker will aim to: (i) predict patient\u2019s response to treatment, separating responders and non-responders and (ii) monitor treatment outcomes, in the case of strategies that target tumor stiffness (i.e., mechanotherapeutics). The DL algorithms will be applied to a large set of existing preclinical data and to additional new data.

During our ongoing ERC CoG project UniSDyn, we have numerically and observationally demonstrated the potential of a novel data product, the internal surface gravity oscillation mode, tracing the sub-surface magnetic field in the Sun, and here formulated methodologies to build prediction tools based on it both over short and long timescales. Earlier prediction methods have relied on magnetic fields on the solar surface or in the interplanetary space, while now we propose to use the solar internal oscillations as basis of the predictions - hence our ideas are novel and ground-braking. Innovation potential is augmented by the demonstrated capacity of the team to perform the demanding data analysis of the required data products for the proof-of-concept tools. Large innovation potential is also contained in new type of data service to be built: they augment the sustainability and re-usability of generic scientific data products, and enhance the renewal of science.",

            "objective": "The new frontier for weather prediction is the so-called subseasonal time scale of two weeks to two months ahead. To take preventive measures at an early stage, reliable forecasts on this time scale are becoming increasingly important for multiple socio-economic sectors. Subseasonal predictability can be gained from recurring patterns in the Earth system. ASPIRE will focus on one of these, namely modes of tropical convective variability. Long-standing systematic errors due to the parametrization of processes in numerical weather prediction models prevent the predictability of these modes from being exploited. Simply running models at a resolution high enough to resolve tropical convection is not feasible due to high computational costs. Taking advantage of three recent developments, ASPIRE will explore new ways to better exploit the intrinsic predictability of tropical convective modes without exhausting the currently available computing resources.\nThe uniqueness of ASPIRE is its cross-disciplinary approach that builds on my experience in atmospheric dynamics and predictability, numerical modeling, and machine learning (ML). First, ASPIRE will identify the source regions and pathways of tropical forecast errors that prevent the intrinsic predictability from being exploited using a new set of subseasonal ensemble hindcasts. Second, ASPIRE will quantify for the first time the added value of locally confined kilometer-scale resolution in the source regions identified before, and generate probabilistic predictions from deterministic forecasts through ML-based post-processing. Third, to enable simulations at kilometer-scale resolution in operations, ASPIRE will develop ML approaches that emulate the integrated effect of the resolved convection in the tropics at substantially reduced costs. If successful, this approach would be a breakthrough towards improved operational weather forecasts at substantially lower computational costs, for a global socio-economic benefit.",

Despite this progress, the quantum devices we currently have, the so-called noisy, intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, are too imperfect to run textbook quantum algorithms, yet they hold great potential. With their advent, much research has been devoted to finding them a first practical application. Focus on optimization, quantum chemistry and machine learning has been intense, and the developments are closely monitored by governments and industry alike. Variational algorithms in a classical-quantum feedback loop and adiabatic algorithms have been the dominant paradigm. However, important bottle-necks remain that severely maim the performance of NISQ devices and the field yearns for a novel approach.\nFINE-TEA-SQUAD, FIrst NEar-TErm ApplicationS of QUAntum Devices, proposes a radically new vision: to develop a unifying framework that will yield the first practical applications of NISQ devices. The main objectives are (A) to design experimentally-friendly protocols for quantum state preparation circumventing major existing bottlenecks (high number of repetitions, noise-induced barren plateaus...) and characterize broad families of states that can be prepared in a scalable way, (B) to develop a practical certification toolset amenable to near-term devices, with especial focus on the generation of certified randomness from a single NISQ device. The key idea is to use the hardness of many-body physics in a classical verifier-quantum prover interactive protocol. This approach will overcome the existing limitations of current approaches: it will be both easy to prepare and easy to verify (C) to overcome current hardware scalability limitations by combining several NISQ nodes into a small quantum network, and develop the appropriate theoretical framework to efficiently tailor and run quantum algorithms on them.",

However, despite impressive proof-of-concept results, currently existing approaches that rely on sparsely coupled qubits, are not scalable to network sizes and connectivities with tunable weights required for state-of-the art tasks. In qDynnet, I will adopt a completely new and unexplored approach that uses parametrically coupled superconducting quantum oscillators instead of physically coupled qubits, that will allow me to obtain quantum neural networks of unprecedented size, connectivity and tunability. To do this, I will shift the paradigm by implementing neurons as basis states of dynamically coupled multi-level quantum oscillators, and connections between neurons as transition rates obtained through different dynamical processes such as parametric coupling, resonant drives and dissipation.  I will implement experimentally quantum neural network architectures that were only simulated until now and use them to demonstrate data classification with basis state neurons. In order to go towards more complex tasks, I will use parametric coupling to introduce tunable connections between neurons. I will develop new training methods that will allow me to tune connections in such dynamical quantum neural networks and use them to demonstrate learning to recognize quantum states. I will develop circuit geometries that will be scalable to large quantum neural networks with millions of neurons and tunable connections. The qDynnet project will provide understanding of physics, and methods for dynamical coupling and training, that will have a broad impact across quantum computing fields and serve as a foundation for a whole new family of large-scale dynamical quantum neural networks.",

Recently emerged persistent memory technology (PMEM) offers larger-than-ever RAM spaces, but its performance is far from that of customary DRAM technologies. This project aims at sparking a new class of system architectures for encrypted DL workloads, by eliminating or dramatically reducing data movements across memory/storage hierarchies and network, supported by PMEM technology, overcoming its current severe performance limitations. HomE intends to be a first-time enabler for the encrypted execution of large models that do not fit in DRAM footprints to execute local to accelerators, hundreds of DL models to run simultaneously, and large datasets to be run at high resolution and accuracy. Targeting these ground-breaking goals, HomE enters into unexplored field resulting from the innovative convergence of several disciplines, where wide-ranging research is required in order to assess current and future feasibility. Its main challenge is to develop methodology capable of breaking through the existing software and hardware limitations. HomE proposes a holistic approach yielding highly impactful outcomes that include novel comprehensive performance characterisation, innovative optimisations upon current technology, and pioneering hardware proposals. HomE can spawn a paradigm shift that will revolutionise the convergence of the machine learning and cryptography disciplines, filling a gap of knowledge and opening new horizons such as DL training on HE, currently too demanding even for DRAM.

Hardware implementation of digital DL can help reduce energy usage, but the Von Neumann architecture of current DL has hindered its practical realization. In contrast, the brain exhibits energy-efficient multiscale spatiotemporal processing. Biologically plausible (BiP) frameworks have emerged as alternatives to mainstream DL. These methods use bottom-up and top-down signals, incorporating feedforward and feedback mechanisms, and local objectives instead of global error. Recently, I demonstrated that a BiP opto-analog hardware can achieve competitive performance compared to digital DL for feedforward networks. However, transformers, the backbone of current DL, are challenging to implement due to the input-dependent quadratic complexity in the transformer's attention. This project leverages the multiscale dynamics in the primary vision system to explore BiP architectures for transformers.\n\nThe project is hosted at the University of T\u00fcbingen under Matthias Bethge and Thomas Euler, who have a long-standing effort in the system identification of mouse retina via DL. The project has three objectives. First, I will extract top-down information from neural recordings of ganglion cells in the mouse retina, focusing on unique spatiotemporal features that maximally activate specific cell types. Next, I will combine top-down signals with bottom-up models of the retina using recurrent architectures with linear complexity and compare their performance in classification tasks to a vision transformer for the retina. Lastly, I propose a BiP transformer with local weight updates. I will examine the robustness of models under data distribution shifts and noise injection.

This knowledge gap leaves individuals with or at high risk of T2D without effective prevention or control strategies, urging a paradigm shift in our approach. The GLUCOTYPES project brings together leading experts in nutrition, metabolic diseases, glycobiology, gut microbiome, epidemiology, and machine learning from five European countries to tackle this challenge. Our strategy capitalises on advancements in wearable technologies, molecular biology, and bioinformatics. We propose to leverage high-temporal continuous glucose monitor data to identify patterns of early glycaemic alterations, a concept we refer to as glucotypes and forms the core hypothesis of our research program. Circulating and adipose tissue glycoproteomics profiling will be used to gain molecular insights into glucotypes. Machine learning algorithms will be applied to investigate the intersection between diet and glucotypes on clinical outcomes and gain mechanistic insights into how diet and gut microbiome influence glucose homeostasis in specific glucotypes. The knowledge derived from these activities will inform a proof-of-concept precision nutrition clinical study to test the efficacy of a precision-based diet on cardiometabolic outcomes and identify markers of beneficial responses to diet. In doing so, GLUCOTYPES will come closer to understanding the divergent mechanisms that influence early glycaemic alterations and how specific diets could ameliorate these alterations.

Advances have been limited by microbiome complexity and inter-individual variance. DiBaN binds together the necessary combination of expertise to address this question, based on the concept that the initial driver of the nutritional effects is the metabolic shift that takes place in the intestinal bacteria which is transduced to the host. In this context, technological breakthrough tools for novel food development, that ensure the promotion of a healthy microbiome-host metabolic interface, are an urgent need to prevent dysbiosis and T2D. DiBaN will overcome current limitations in nutrient-testing by developing advanced ex-vivo platforms that fully recapitulate the in vivo setting of dysbiosis and insulin resistance, that will be validated with in vivo omic data. To warrantee the health promoting effects of novel foods we will test a new concept in the emerging field of insect food technology, that an adequate insect\u2019s metabolic-intestinal health ensures the healthy properties of its derived products.

            "objective": "Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) are porous materials with many societally relevant potential applications, such as carbon capture, removal of environmental toxins and drug-delivery. Despite the progress in the field, synthesizing a MOF currently requires tens to hundreds costly and time-consuming trial-and-error synthesis experiments because our ability to correlate the synthesis conditions with the desired MOF structure is very limited. To overcome this, we need to decode the mechanisms underlying MOF self-assembly, a highly complex non-equilibrium process covering a wide range of time- and length-scales, from the formation of the building units to nucleation and growth.\nIn MAGNIFY, my team and I will develop a multi-scale computational methodology that will decode the mechanisms underlying MOF self-assembly and predict synthesis conditions-structure relationships. This ambitious interdisciplinary project combines state-of-the-art multi-scale modelling techniques (enhanced sampling techniques, ab initio, atomistic and coarse-graining modelling), with machine-learning approaches to data analysis (dimensionality reduction and data clustering techniques) trained on new chemical descriptors. We will develop and validate our models in tandem with synthesis experiments. We will test our methodology by applying it to two central problems in MOF rational design: (i) determining how synthesis conditions (temperature, solvent, reactants, metal-to-ligand ratio, additives) drive the resulting MOF material's topology and point defects, as well as to (ii) tackling the very challenging task of predicting the synthesis conditions for producing brand new MOFs. This high-risk high-gain project will produce a breakthrough in the MOF field by enabling fast and resource-efficient MOF rational design and will open new research avenues in investigating the self-assembly of other materials and other complex processes happening through a large span of time- and length-scales.",

            "objective": "Drug delivery systems are often needed for delivering drugs in a targeted organ or tissue at a desired concentration range and without toxic side effects. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as promising drug delivery systems due to their high loading capacity, but currently this is also their main limitation as it results in too rapid drug release in the human body, causing an excessive response and potentially toxic side effects. Slowing down the drug release rate, while maintaining high loading capacity and biocompatibility, would enable applications within especially cancer therapy.\n\nDisordered MOFs (i.e., MOFs without an ordered crystalline structure) have smaller pores and more torturous pathways for drug release. The project\u2019s proposed strategy is to load anti-cancer drugs in the crystalline MOF with high surface area and thus high loading capacity and then subsequently subject this material to an order-to-disorder transition, giving rise to slower drug release. This transition can be induced by either mechanical ball milling or thermal melt-quenching. Molecular dynamics and classification-based machine learning will be used to identify which local atomic structures are best correlated with drug release rate in disordered MOFs. Experimental validation will be performed to establish design principles for MOF structures with a tailored drug release profile.\n\nThe project builds on complementary expertise of the fellow applicant (disordered biomaterials, in vitro studies) and supervisor (MOFs, simulations, machine learning). Combined with the research and training environment offered by the host organization (Aalborg University, Denmark), this will ensure the achievement of this novel project as well as the dissemination and exploitation of the results. The goal is to develop principles for designing disordered MOFs for drug delivery.

The pollination of plants is not only significant for human society in agriculture but it is also the trophic basis of the food webs that support all the other trophic layers of animals that are currently endangered in the 6th mass extinction that we are currently facing. We will equip a honeycomb that fits into a conventional beehive with a micro-robotic system that can reach every single cell on the comb. Thus, we will be able to inspect the content of each cell selectively and store its assessment into a database, containing the history of each single comb cell over years. The robot will photograph the brood in the cell at full-size from a short distance, allowing its size and health measurement. SENSORBEES will perform specific manipulations on these comb cells, for maximizing and ensuring pollination service to the environment, to favor and support plant diversity, and to defend itself against detrimental developments. Moreover, we will equip the hive with a smart pollen trap capable of selective collection and visual analysis of the pollen brought into the hive by the bees. The pollen influx, along with the data collected by the robotic agents in the hive will provide information about the health of the colony as well as on the diversity of plants within the foraging area of the bees, i.e. 5-10 km around the hive, thus sample areas of 78-314 sq km. Health estimates on the colony level can be made by looking for anomalies in brood growth and breeding success and by comparing the data streams from the hive entrance, local weather data and brood dynamics.

Our solution, interoperable, fast to deploy and easy to use, is based in the analysis of different data sources such as Copernicus (Satellite data), Meteo patterns and OpenData.\n\nMARKET OPPORTUNITY.

From this, we can learn design principles of (organic) solar cells. Secondly, controlling the downregulation of photosynthesis is seen as a strategy for the optimization of crop productivity especially by means of novel tools and biotechnological solutions. In the Doctoral Network \"Photosynthetic Antennas in a Computational Microscope\" we aim at training a new generation of computational scientists which can treat complex and interdisciplinary problems such as light harvesting on a molecular level using theoretical and computational tools. The interdisciplinary nature of the problem requires a combined knowledge from biology, chemistry, physics and computer science in order to combine state-of-the-art approaches like molecular dynamics simulations, quantum chemistry, theoretical spectroscopy and machine learning into multi-scale schemes. This joint undertaking is a unique chance in research but especially also in training young scientists in interdisciplinary teamwork, method training and high-performance computing in academic as well as non-academic settings.  Aim of the Doctoral Network is a detailed molecular understanding of light harvesting from the computational point of view and especially of the downregulatory mechanisms of photosynthesis present in higher plants and diatoms.

Although the majority of absorbed light is used for carbon assimilation, a remaining part is lost as heat and dissipated as emissions of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF). SIF, the radiant flux emitted between 650 and 800 nm, is therefore the most direct measurable reporter of photosynthetic machinery in plants. Dedicated to retrieve the full SIF signal emitted across the globe, ESA has selected the FLuorescence EXplorer (FLEX) mission concept as Earth Explorer 8. To be launched in 2024, FLEX will fly in tandem with Copernicus\u2019 Sentinel-3 (S3) and will operate at ideal spectral, spatial and temporal resolutions. We are only at the dawn of uncovering the full SIF potential from space, as so far only a few single SIF bands have been exploited. The key challenge in the upcoming FLEX era will be to explore this unique new source of information and link it to photosynthetic activity. This proposal - named FLEXINEL - is determined to take leadership in exploiting and interpreting the forthcoming FLEX data stream targeting European vegetation productivity and carbon fluxes monitoring, given state of the art in plant physiology, leaf-canopy-atmosphere radiative transfer mechanisms, machine learning and image processing. FLEXINEL seeks to advance the science in consolidating relationships between SIF products and complementary S3 vegetation traits, thereby uncovering the role of dynamic vegetative and atmospheric variables given a changing Earth. Together with physically-based modelling, latest image processing concepts will be applied, such as emulation and cloud computing. FLEX and S3 products will be fed into assimilation systems for quantifying photosynthesis dynamics, and into an operational biosphere model for improving Europe-to-global carbon flux estimation.",

Hence, an application can be freely built by distributing the processing, data fusion and control across heterogeneous sensors, devices and edges with ubiquitous low-latency connectivity. The goal of this project is to develop a SMARTEDGE solution with a low-code tool programming environment with various tools: (1) Continuous Semantic Integration (CSI); (2) Dynamic Swarm Network (DSW); and (3) Low-code Toolchain for Edge Intelligence. CSI allows the SMARTEDGE solution to interact with devices according to a (i) standardized semantic interface, via a (ii) continuous conversion process based on declarative mappings and scalable from edge to cloud, and (iii) providing a declarative approach for the creation and orchestration of apps based on swarm intelligence. DSW provides (i) automatic discovery and dynamic network swarm formation in near real time, (ii) hardware-accelerated in-network operations for context-aware swarm networking, and (iii) embedded network security. The low-code tool chain provides (i) semantic-driven multimodal stream fusion for Edge devices; (ii) swarm elasticity via Edge-Cloud Interplay; (iii) adaptive coordination and optimization; (iv) cross-layer toolchain for Device-Edge-Cloud Continuum. The SMARTEDGE solution will be comprehensively demonstrated  over four application areas: automotive, city,  factory and heath via the strong collaboration of eight industrial partners, Dell, Siemens, Bosch, IMC, Conveq, Cefiel and NVIDIA with eight research institutes.",

The full potential of MOFs for target applications can only be unlocked if the storage and transport properties for important chemical and biological guest molecules trapped in the pores of each MOF are known. In this project, I will create a materials intelligence ecosystem for precisely assessing guest storage and transport properties of all MOFs by combining state-of-the-art atomistic calculations, molecular simulations, machine learning, and data science, integrated with past and future experiments. I will focus on ten critical guest molecules to address the key societal challenges of our world: hydrogen and methane to use MOFs for clean energy storage; ammonia, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide to use MOFs for capturing toxic gas and combatting global warming; fluorouracil, methotrexate, nitrogen, oxygen to use MOFs as nanocarriers for anti-cancer drug therapy and biomedicine. The ground-breaking gains of my project will include the creation of the world\u2019s first database for guest storage and transport properties of millions of MOFs; accurate assessments of new technologies by precise MOF-application matching; and generating design guidelines for high-performing MOFs to accelerate discovery of new materials.

Theoretical studies have shown that electric fields can promote gas storage in MOFs by inducing controlled structural changes, which has recently been experimentally confirmed.\n\nTo unravel the underlying mechanisms at the atomic level, I aim to investigate the H2 storage characteristics of electric field responsive MOFs by combining machine learning (ML) and molecular modeling methods. In order to model switchable MOFs, I will construct machine learning potentials and use them in Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations in order to overcome the restricted time and length scales of ab-Initio MD, and the accuracy and reliability concerns of MD. In order to determine the H2 uptakes of the MOFs, I will push the limits further and combine machine learning potentials with the Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations. \n\nThe main research objectives are to generate accurate machine learning potentials with a low computational time cost, determine how selected MOFs react to an applied electric field, control pore opening/closing, control and improve H2 uptake by switching electric field, determine the impact of an electric field on the interaction between the host and H2 as well as on the presence of different adsorption sites.

Initiatives to reduce this burden in Europe involve early and precise diagnosis in the standard-of-care management to decrease unnecessary or insufficient treatment. Notably, precision medicine in BC is still in its infancy and is becoming even more critical with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), a standard of care treatment protocol in HER2-positive (HER2+) and triple negative (TN) subtypes. Recently, the use of digital diagnostics with AI is gaining momentum since it shows great promise towards accelerating personalized BC patients\u2019 pre- and post-NAC predictions. While AI paves the way to next generation diagnostics, this has yet from been translated as a) it mostly operates in single data modalities that fail to capture the complex disease alterations, b) integrated AI usually suffers from data incompleteness usually leading to models trained with limited data that fail to generalize to new patients and/or that are not able to integrate partially observed multimodal information from the whole population. GRANITE focuses to address these unmet needs and goes beyond the state of the art, fusing the most relevant standard of care data (radiology, pathology, clinical, demographic), leveraging novel AI and state-of-the-art image analysis (radiomics) based on the extensive previous work of the experienced researcher (ER). GRANITE will deploy pre-trained DL models from the ER and fine-tuned, technically validated and clinically evaluated using more than 150 non-metastatic BC cases from the Bank of Cyprus Oncology Centre (BoCOC). ER\u2019s participation in the AI4HI project will help transcend FUTURE-AI guidelines (Fairness, Universality, Traceability, Usability, Robustness and Explainability; future-ai.eu) into GRANITE to generate real-world evidence and make our AI clinically sound, ethically aware and technically applicable, and to promote AI trust and and acceptance in BC management.",

It is responsible for almost 30% of all cancers in women and current trends show its increasing incidence. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has shown promise in reducing mortality for advanced cases, but the therapy is associated with a high rate of over-treatment, as well as with significant side effects for the patients. For predicting NAC respondents and improving patient selection, artificial intelligence (AI) approaches based on radiomics have shown promising preclinical evidence, but existing studies have mostly focused on evaluating model accuracy, all-too-often in homogeneous populations.\n\nRadioVal is the first multi-centre, multi-continental and multi-faceted clinical validation of radiomics-driven estimation of NAC response in breast cancer. The project builds on the repositories, tools and results of five EU-funded projects from the AI for Health Imaging (AI4HI) Network, including a large multi-centre cancer imaging dataset on NAC treatment in breast cancer. To test applicability as well as transferability, the validation with take place in eight clinical centres from three high-income EU countries (Sweden, Austria, Spain), two emerging EU countries (Poland, Croatia), and three countries from South America (Argentina), North Africa (Egypt) and Eurasia (Turkey). \n\nRadioVal will develop a comprehensive and standardised methodological framework for multi-faceted radiomics evaluation based on the FUTURE-AI Guidelines, to assess Fairness, Universality, Traceability, Usability, Robustness and Explainability. Furthermore, the project will introduce new tools to enable transparent and continuous evaluation and monitoring of the radiomics tools over time. The RadioVal study will be implemented through a multi-stakeholder approach, taking into account clinical and healthcare needs, as well as socio-ethical and regulatory requirements from day one.",

Below is a detailed evaluation based on the criteria provided:\n\n1. Minor Objectives or Methods: Both projects focus on using AI and radiomics for breast cancer diagnostics and treatment planning. They share similar techniques but differ in their specific execution contexts (single-centre versus multi-centre, regional versus international). (1 point)\n\n2. Overlapping Goals, Methodologies, or Innovations: Both projects aim to improve the precision of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) predictions for breast cancer patients, incorporating AI and radiomics, and adhere to the FUTURE-AI guidelines. However, GRANITE addresses data incompleteness and diverse data modalities while RadioVal emphasizes multi-centre, multi-continental validation. (1 point)\n\n3. Key Similarities in Scope, Methodology, and Innovation: Both projects utilize advanced AI models and radiomics, adhere to the FUTURE-AI guidelines, and focus on improving NAC predictions. The distinct elements, such as the scale (single-centre vs. multi-centre) and geographic reach, might warrant separate execution. Resource efficiency may not be substantially improved if merged, and some moderate benefits would be yielded. (1 point)\n\n4. Close Alignment in Scope, Methodology, and Innovation: Both projects are closely aligned in scope, addressing critical aspects of breast cancer treatment using AI and radiomics. Merging these projects would likely improve resource efficiency and overall research output, avoiding duplication of efforts, especially in data collection and AI model training. However, there is value in distinct regional implementations and localised model validation. (1 point)\n\n5. Nearly Identical in Scope, Methodology, and Innovation: While the projects share substantial similarities, they are not identical. RadioVal\u2019s international approach and multi-centre validation add a layer of complexity not present in the GRANITE project. Merging is beneficial but not essential, as they still hold distinct objectives and contexts.\n\nConsidering the above points, a score of 4 out of 5 is assigned. Merging the projects could provide significant advantages in terms of resource use and consistency in methodological frameworks, but the regional focus and localized data aspects of GRANITE should be carefully considered in the merging strategy. Keeping them separate with collaboration might be an optimal approach.",

This move will introduce significant new multidisciplinary research challenges emerging throughout the wireless communication protocol stacks, including the way the mobile network is modelled and deployed. The structure of 6G networks will be highly heterogeneous, densely deployed, and dynamic. Combined with the tight quality of services, such complex architecture will result in the untenability of legacy network operation routines. In response, artificial intelligence (AI), especially machine learning (ML), Semantic Communication and Digital Twin (DT) are emerging as solutions to realize the fully intelligent network orchestration and management. By learning from uncertain and dynamic environments, AI-enabled channel estimation and spectrum management will open up opportunities for bringing the excellent performance of Ultra-broadband techniques into full play. Additionally, challenges brought by Ultra-massive access concerning energy and security can be mitigated by applying AI-based approaches.\n \nThe overall research objective of the SCION project is to develop and design the network systems for seamless wireless access for Secure and Intelligent Massive Machine-to-Machine Communications for 6G.

In this complex and dynamic network ecosystem, an optimized end-to-end satellite support is key to manage requirements imposed by multiple vertical industries requiring full global connectivity. The European space sector acknowledged this as a key opportunity to expand its business towards the massive deployment of broadband services, what resulted in standardization efforts to adapt 5G to satellite needs. In this context, the aim of TRANTOR is to perform a significant step forward by paving the path for the 5G NTN evolution towards 6G. To do so, TRANTOR targets the in-orbit validation of a complete satellite value chain involving an automated management of satellite resources across multiple bands, satellites, and orbits, and a converged radio access network. Specifically, at the ground segment, TRANTOR targets the development of novel satellite network management solutions, fully integrated in the 3GPP management framework, which allow the significant scaling up of heterogeneous satellite traffic demands and capacities in a cost-effective, highly dynamic, band and orbit agnostic manner. AI governance will be a main pillar here enabling real time radio resource management across multiple satellite systems for efficiently and trustworthy addressing satellite client needs. In parallel, in the user segment, TRANTOR aims to radically increase the flexibility of access architecture by enabling pre-6G non-terrestrial multi-connectivity. It will be supported by the design of a multi-orbit and multi-band antenna for satellite UEs as well as by the development of gNB and UE 5G NTN equipment able to attend the multi-connectivity needs. Finally, TRANTOR aims to introduce security mechanisms to provide resilience to all types of cyber-threads, specially those emerging from the integrated management and multi-connectivity framework proposed.",

This offers enormous possibilities for improvements in human economy and wellbeing. However, it also poses strong risks that are difficult to assess and control by humans. The trend towards increased autonomy conveys augmented problems concerning reliability, resilience, and trust for autonomous robots in open worlds. The essence of the problem can be traced to robots suffering from a lack of understanding of what is going on and a lack of awareness of their role in it. This is a problem that artificial intelligence approaches based on machine learning are not addressing well. Autonomous robots do not fully understand their open environments, their complex missions, their intricate realizations, and the unexpected events that affect their performance. An improvement in the capability to understand of autonomous robots is needed. This project tries to provide a solution to this need in the form of 1) a theory of understanding, 2) a theory of awareness, 3) reusable software assets to apply these theories in real robots, and 4) three demonstrations of its capability to a) augment resilience of drone teams, b) augment flexibility of manufacturing robots, and c) augment human alignment of social robots. In summary, we will develop a cognitive architecture for autonomous robots based on a formal concept of understanding, supporting value-oriented situation understanding and self-awareness to improve robot flexibility, resilience and explainability.",

While machine learning has unlocked new potentials for robot autonomy, as robots venture into the real world, physical interactions with the surrounding environment pose additional challenges. One typical challenge in practical applications is providing safety guarantees in robot decision-making. Much of the safe robot decision-making literature today focuses on explicit safety constraints defined in the robot state and input space. However, in practical applications, robots are often required to infer semantics-grounded safe actions from perception input. While recent machine learning techniques are increasingly capable of distilling semantic information from perception, translating the semantic understanding to explicit safety constraints is non-trivial. In this proposed project, we aim to close the perception-action loop and develop mathematical foundations and algorithmic tools that enable robots to make intelligent and semantically safe decisions.",

The project aims to develop a Fully Autonomous Search Tool to Investigate Directly Images and mOdeling of Unexplored Strong-lenses (FASTIDIoUS). The objectives of the FASTIDIoUS project are 1) to increase the sample of known strong lensing clusters using deep learning techniques, 2) to develop and model with an automated pipeline multiple galaxy-scale lenses within clusters to study their formation and evolution, and 3) to expand one model to the full cluster to make the first comparison between a state-of-the-art model based on image positions only and a model based on the image pixel values directly, yielding insight in the effect of constraining the mass parameters through the pixel values and allowing a source surface brightness reconstruction, as so far only performed with galaxy-scale lenses. The FASTIDIoUS project that I will carry out at the University of Milan is an innovative project built to impact several areas within the galaxy evolution and strong lensing fields. I will bring extensive experience in strong lens modeling and some unique expertise with deep learning tools applied to various astrophysical aspects.

We propose a paradigm shift in the modeling and conceptual understanding of electrostatic and electrodynamic molecular interactions in many-particle systems from the perspective of (quantum) field theory. This development is critical to accurately and efficiently model increasingly intricate and functional molecular ensembles with millions of atoms subject to external excitations (static, thermal, and optical fields; variation in the number of particles; and/or arbitrary macroscopic boundary conditions). This molecular size covers a wide range of functional biological systems, including solvated protein/protein and enzyme/DNA complexes. The theoretical developments in this project will concentrate on two main fronts: (WP1) fundamental quantum electrodynamics (QED) theory of molecular interactions based on many-body oscillator Hamiltonians, (WP2) second-quantized field theory (FIT) approach to molecular Hamiltonians for modeling large-scale systems with 10^4-10^6 atoms. The applicability of these challenging developments to realistic molecules will be ensured by: (WP3) implementation of non-local machine learning force fields based on second-quantized matrix Hamiltonians for efficient molecular dynamics simulations of molecular ensembles, (WP4) implementation of QED/FIT methods in an open-source package FITMOL for increasing the accuracy, improving the efficiency, and enhancing the insight that one obtains from quantum-mechanical calculations of large molecules. It is my vision that revealing fundamental mechanisms of functional (bio)molecules with millions of atoms requires a radically new field-theory approach to molecular interactions.

        "justification": "Both research projects are focused on advanced quantum dynamics simulations and share an intent to innovate and enhance computational methods for understanding large-scale quantum systems. NG-Quapi deals with quasi-adiabatic propagator path integral (Quapi) methods for non-equilibrium relaxation dynamics in quantum systems strongly interacting with their environment. FITMOL focuses on a field-theory approach to model electrostatic and electrodynamic molecular interactions in molecular systems with millions of atoms, leveraging quantum electrodynamics (QED) and second-quantized field theory (FIT). Both employ machine learning and quantum algorithm-based approaches to improve computational efficiency. However, NG-Quapi aims to develop new methods specifically for non-Markovian dynamics and modeling more complex environments using neural networks and quantum devices, while FITMOL is centered on implementing a new field-theory perspective for modeling molecular interactions, particularly in biological systems. Despite significant overlaps in methodology and innovation such as the use of machine learning and quantum advancements, the projects possess distinct objectives. NG-Quapi is more focused on the condensed phase quantum dynamics in the presence of strong environmental interactions, whereas FITMOL is driven by modeling molecular interactions from a fundamental QED perspective. Merging them could lead to some benefits in terms of resource sharing, but the distinction in primary research goals and application areas suggests that they could provide more value if pursued independently while maintaining some level of coordination.",

IoT leads to a high automation potential with which we improve the life of billions of people and compensate for societal problems such as a growingly old population, missing high-skilled labour across Europe or the efficiency limits in current production capabilities. IoT5.0, an Artificial Intelligence (AI) -assisted Internet of Things, could even more benefit society, as the devices could even learn how to provide more value. But the ubiquitous connectivity comes at a cost. Security levels have to rise tremendously to ensure a network stays secure and safe for humans. This additional effort often is a burden for small and medium sized enterprises as the complexity and security demands of such systems rise faster than available resources. This is especially dangerous as a single corrupted, malicious device can result in the exploitation of the entire network of connected devices by an attacker. Consequently, RESILIENT TRUST focuses on end-to-end security of IoT processing chains with a focus on strong exploitation for SMEs. This vision will be realized by developing specialized hardware to establish TRUST in-between a network and a wall of RESILIENCE even against new attack methods such as post quantum attacks and AI based attacks. The architecture of the secure processing chain will be carefully built after threat modelling, asset identification, risk analysis, security objectives and requirements definition. Consequently, RESILIENT TRUST will address and significantly mitigate these major risks to enable IoT5.0. That way this project will be a driver for sustainable development and the generation of convenience and wealth. A solution is proposed to ensure end-to-end security by boosting RESILIENCE and TRUST along different key supply chains of IoT device",

The research breakthroughs and innovation of 6G-GOALS are three-fold: First, 6G-GOALS will develop AI/ML-empowered semantic data representation, sensing, and compression algorithms combining data-and-model-driven approaches, and work towards exploiting untapped gains from AI-based joint source-channel coding. Second, 6G-GOALS will introduce semantic-oriented solutions for supporting distributed reasoning and time-sensitive communication, generalizing low- latency of 5G by tailoring communication to the actual goal.

In that sense, cell-free massive MIMO, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), and edge intelligence are anticipated to be key technologies in the 6G era. \n\nDIRACFEC is a 24-months research project that thus concentrates on the Design of Intelligent RIS-Aided Cell-Free networks for Energy-efficient Coexistence between evolved eMBB (eMBB+) and evolved mMTC (mMTC+). More specifically, considering user-centric architectures and distributed multiple antenna deployments, we will present a set of multiple access schemes, edge intelligence techniques, and transmission strategies that optimize the energy efficiency in a heterogeneous service environment, aiming at the coexistence of eMBB+ and mMTC+ services. We will conceive mathematical frameworks to model dense networks where several RISs are controlled by multiple antenna access points. Then, to boost the ultimate performance, we will design the aforementioned approaches for different types of data traffic under the assumption of imperfect channel knowledge. These solutions will be evaluated using numerical and industry level system-level simulations in practical setups.\n\nThe project will be carried out by the researcher at the University of Cassino and Lazio Meridionale (Italy), under the supervision of\nProf. Stefano Buzzi. Furthermore, Nokia Bell Labs (France) will host the researcher for a six-months secondment\naimed at validation of the developed solutions on industry level system simulators.

Besides the reduction of critical material, and decrease of cost, optimising the lifetime of the EV  components is essential to ease their adoption, especially the powertrain sub-components that have the major impact on EV cost and CO2 emissions. A new-generation of diagnostic and prognostic systems for the powertrain will be a game changer to ensure EV adoption, because they will estimate its degradation, anticipate failures, and ease reparability thus extending its lifespan. With significant improvement of sensors, complex modelling and data processing methods such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), predictive maintenance (PdM) has gained a lot of interest in different fields. Development of PdM methods for the sub-components of the EV powertrain (battery, fuel cell, e-motor, power electronics) is at the heart of TEAMING. Thanks to international staff exchanges, TEAMING will significantly improve the different facets of the PdM solution: sensors, modelling, Digital Twins, adapted AI, and Physics-Informed Machine Learning methods are at the centre of the studies and present a major potential in term of innovation.

Despite their success, DL methods do not obey most of the wisdoms of statistical learning theory, and the vast majority of the current DL techniques mainly stand as poorly understood black-box algorithms. \n\nEven though DL theory has been a very active research field in the past few years, there is a significant gap between the current theory and practice: (i) the current theory often becomes vacuous for models with large number of parameters (which is typical in DL), and (ii) it cannot capture the interaction between data, architecture, training algorithm and its hyper-parameters, which can have drastic effects on the overall performance. Due to this lack of theoretical understanding, designing new DL systems has been dominantly performed by ad-hoc, 'trial-and-error' approaches.\n\nThe main objective of this proposal is to develop a mathematically sound and practically relevant theory for DL, which will ultimately serve as the basis of a software library that provides practical tools for DL practitioners. In particular, (i) we will develop error bounds that closely reflect the true empirical performance, by explicitly incorporating the dynamics aspect of training, (ii) we will develop new model selection, training, and compression algorithms with reduced time/memory/storage complexity, by exploiting the developed theory.\n\nTo achieve the expected breakthroughs, we will develop a novel theoretical framework, which will enable tight analysis of learning algorithms in the lens of dynamical systems theory. The outcomes will help relieve DL from being a black-box system and avoid the heuristic design process.

However, to achieve this, it is necessary to understand how those activities affect biodiversity so that evidence-based conservation interventions can be made. Therefore, effective monitoring tools are needed that can be used to survey biodiversity changes over large spatial and temporal scales. Conventional monitoring tools, based on expert field surveys, are time-consuming and expensive and, therefore, inappropriate for such large-scale monitoring. Consequently, researchers worldwide are increasingly turning their attention to new technologies. When it comes to monitoring vocalizing animals, such as birds, which have been shown to be appropriate indicators of biodiversity, researchers focus on the use of passive acoustic monitoring methods. However, further development of those methods is needed before conservation practitioners can use them widely and reliably in the field to monitor bird communities. BIOMON's main objective is to extend the current state-of-the-art acoustic monitoring approaches through the novel use of machine learning techniques. BIOMON's overarching goal is to develop an innovative passive acoustic monitoring protocol that can be used to survey bird communities in biodiverse agricultural farmlands in the EU. The EU is home to many species of which the persistence depends on low-intensity agricultural areas, and consequently, developing appropriate monitoring tools for those areas remains a key research priority. The methods and monitoring protocol developed in BIOMON, through the collaboration of the ER, a conservation biologist, and the supervisor, a machine learning expert, have the potential to contribute to the objectives of the EU's Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 and other related policies such as the Common Agricultural Policy.",

To handle real-world situations, they need to compute their command as fast as possible, but the advanced, safe control algorithms remain a computational bottleneck. \nTo find the solution to a set of motion specifications and constraints for a robot, a widely used approach is to formulate and solve an optimization problem. The formulation is necessarily imprecise, due to modeling, sensing and estimation errors and the solution will not be executed perfectly by the robot. Yet the optimization solvers used in robotics are designed to converge to an exact solution with high precision, wasting time.\nIn this project, I make a change of paradigm by leveraging approximations and investigate how the absence of need for high precision can be used to develop faster solvers. I study what approximations or errors are acceptable for the problem formulation and the solution, paying attention to the numeric properties of the problem. I use this knowledge to develop a solver tailored for approximate computations, with an emphasize on cheap but imprecise inner iterations and early termination. It will also handle gracefully infeasible situations due to errors, making it safer to operate in real conditions.\nTo make the study, and test and benchmark the solver, I focus on two families of control problems: model predictive control and instantaneous linearized control, applied to a wide variety of systems, from buses, to rockets, to humanoid robots.\nThis solver will have important impacts: make it possible to achieve real-time control for the most complex system; allow to keep real-time, when it was already possible, while enriching the problems; reduce the computing power and energy consumption required for a given robot. Understanding and handling imprecisions would also allow to build less precise and thus cheaper robots.",

COSPIN\u2019S main goal is to create and experimentally validate innovative physical building blocks for a novel nano-scaled, all-spintronic network structure which incorporates all necessary properties for neuromorphic computing including high nonlinearity, interconnectivity and reprogrammability.  By design, COSPIN works at the boundary between oscillator-based computing and wave-based computing. It uses interference, frequency-multiplexing, and time-modulation techniques as well as spin-wave amplification to significantly increase the connectivity between neurons. Reprogramming of the network is implemented by a direct physical link to magnetic memory solutions as well as by reconfiguring spin-wave circuits. By using coherent wave interference and nonlinear wave interaction, COSPIN paves the way for novel coupling phenomena for complex artificial neural networks far beyond the state-of-the-art of current hardware realizations. Using cutting-edge micromagnetic simulations enhanced by inverse design methods, the artificial networks will be designed and tested prior to their nano-fabrication.

However, to achieve even greater efficiency, NC requires hardware that also mimics the behavior of neurons and synapses. Memristive synapses are pivotal components in emulating the synaptic plasticity observed in biological neural networks. Nevertheless, the implementation of spintronic memristors compatible with state-of-the-art computing is challenging due to the large current density needed,  the long switching times present in ferromagnets and the need of small applied magnetic fields.   The objective of this project is then to design, fabricate, and characterize field-free memristive synapses using Gd-based ferrimagnets. We will use two approaches: all-optical magnetic switching and the use of multiferroics to switch the magnetization by the application of electric fields. By taking advantage of the unique properties of ferrimagnets, ultrafast and energy efficient magnetic switching, we aim to develop highly efficient synapses that exhibit memristive behavior without the need for an external magnetic field.",

AI has been rapidly growing in various industries, from financial services to healthcare, education, and job recruitment. However, as AI algorithms have become increasingly sophisticated and pervasive in decision-making processes, concerns have arisen about their fairness and compliance with regulations. In particular, the EU AI Act requires that AI providers in high-risk applications -- such as employment, credit, or healthcare -- to identify (and thereby address) discrimination by their algorithms against certain demographics of people. However, ensuring compliance with the Act can be challenging, particularly for AI startups that may not have the resources or expertise to fully understand and implement the Act's requirements. Addressing existing disconnects between AI fairness toolkits' capabilities and current practitioner needs, the Act.AI tool can be easily integrated into any AI workflow, in a plug and play fashion, to continuously monitor and improve its fairness. A key aspect of Act.AI is the ability to operate with different types of data (tabular, images, and text) in a variety of contexts (binary and multiclass classification and regression). It is also able to match datasets in different domains including out-of-distribution data even if these datasets have different numbers of variables or features. To ensure usability of Act.AI, it will integrate feedback from relevant stakeholders from two immediate target markets: financial service and healthcare.",

In order for autonomous vehicles to safely navigate a scene, they need to understand the dynamic objects around it. In other words, we need computer vision algorithms to perform dynamic scene understanding (DSU), i.e., detection, segmentation, and tracking of multiple moving objects in a scene. This is an essential feature for higher-level tasks such as action recognition or decision making for autonomous vehicles. Much of the success of computer vision models for DSU has been driven by the rise of deep learning, in particular, convolutional neural networks trained on large-scale datasets in a supervised way. But the closed-world created by our datasets is not an accurate representation of the real world. If our methods only work on annotated object classes, what happens if a new object appears in front of an autonomous vehicle? We propose to rethink the deep learning models we use, the way we obtain data annotations, as well as the generalization of our models to previously unseen object classes. To bring all the power of computer vision algorithms for DSU to the open-world, we will focus on three lines of research:  1-Models. We will design novel machine learning models to address the shortcomings of convolutional neural networks. A hierarchical (from pixels to objects) image-dependent representation will allow us to capture spatio-temporal dependencies at all levels of the hierarchy. 2-Data. To train our models, we will create a new large-scale DSU synthetic dataset, and propose novel methods to mitigate the annotation costs for video data.  3-Open-World. To bring DSU to the open-world, we will design methods that learn directly from unlabeled video streams.  Our models will be able to detect, segment, retrieve, and track dynamic objects coming from classes never previously observed during the training of our models.",

Empirical evidence from our ERC-funded research of biological vision suggests that eye motion enhances recognition capabilities beyond what could be expected if the eye was functioning as a static camera. Motivated by these findings, here we aim to perform the major computer vision tasks required for many real-life applications, including segmentation, classification and identification, with low-resolution cameras. The idea is to use a series of low-resolution frames from a moving camera, rather than using a single high-resolution image. This novel algorithm, termed here DRVis, can be implemented in software or hardware. Unlike existing solutions that use multiple frames to reconstruct a high resolution image from low resolution ones, DRVis does not need to learn all the particularities needed for reconstruction; instead, it focuses on extracting the necessary features per the given task. The goals of the PoC project are to scale up and diversify our current software system, implement the system in hardware and demonstrate its performance in field conditions and develop the IPR strategy and explore the commercialization potential of our solution. We expect it will be applicable to a wide spectrum of image processing tasks in settings where sensor quality is low but multiple time samples are available including smart agriculture, drone navigation and visual aid devices.",

The current biomanufacturing industry faces a scalability problem. Frequently, producer strains created in the laboratory do not respond well to industrial conditions (e.g., large fermentation volumes, accumulation of toxic intermediates, media acidification, etc.). The goal of BioCircus is to address the issue caused by the lack of robustness of the engineered microbial strains. BioCircus is based on three main research pillars: (1) the construction of biosensor and dynamic regulation circuits that measure and control the production of the target molecule, (2) the use of machine learning predictive models and automation to improve these circuits and (3) validating the designed strains in pre-industrial conditions, closer than standard molecular biology laboratory procedures to real-world bioproduction operations. Naringenin, a key molecule of the flavonoid family, will be used in as proof-of-principle molecule. E. coli will be used as model organism. The design and construction of biosensors and dynamic regulation circuits controlling naringenin production is expected to support the development of methodologies and tools suitable for any other detectable metabolite. BioCircus will produce academic and industrial impacts that will boost the bioproduction field by enabling a shorter strain time-to-market for a wide variety of adaptive and scalable microbial bioproducer strains.",

            "objective": "Despite the impressive advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), current robotic solutions fall short of the expectations when they are requested to operate in partially unknown environments. Most of all, robots lack the cognitive capabilities to understand a task to the point of being able to perform it in a different domain. As humans, during the learning process we gain deep insights on the execution of a process, which allows us to replicate its execution in a different domain with a little effort. We are also able to invert the task execution and to react to contingencies, by focusing the attention to the most critical prediction phases. However, replicating these cognitive processes in AI-driven robots is challenging as it needs a profound rethinking of the robot learning paradigm itself. The robot needs to understand how to act and imagine, like humans do, the possible consequences of its actions in another domain. This demands for a novel framework that embraces different levels of abstraction, starting from physical interaction with the environment, passing through active perception and understanding, and ending-up with decision-making. The INVERSE project aims to provide robots with these essential cognitive abilities by adopting a continual learning approach. After an initial bootstrap phase, used to create initial knowledge from human-level specifications, the robot refines its repertoire by capitalising on its own experience and on human feedback. This experience-driven strategy permits to frame different problems, like performing a task in a different domain, as a problem of fault detection and recovery. Humans have a central role in INVERSE, since their supervision helps limit the complexity of the refinement loop, making the solution suitable for deployment in production scenarios. The effectiveness of developed solutions will be demonstrated in two complementary use cases designed to be a realistic instantiation of the actual work environments.",

Despite the towering success of vaccine development, lack of preparedness on integrative clinical and molecular phenotyping has emerged with clarity and highlights the need to scale translational efforts for personalized prevention and therapy. Of particular concern are the long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection with high and rising prevalence of chronic manifestations referred to as Post-COVID. Among these the neurological and psychiatric complications stand out for frequency, lack of treatment and devastating impact of their effects at pandemic scale. Here, we tackle the cognitive and neurodegenerative complications of COVID-19, referred to as NeuroCOVID, as a ticking pandemic within the pandemic that requires an innovation leap across disciplines. We pursue a multi scalar approach that reaches from epidemiology and mechanistic interrogation of host/virus interplay at single cell resolution through predictive modelling all the way to validation of biomarkers and repurposed drugs. The aim is to anticipate and effectively manage personalized trajectories of NeuroCOVID vulnerability and their impact at population level. For this we leverage two leading national health registries and three clinical cohorts to characterize the phenotypic spectrum of NeuroCOVID, its risk factors and its socioeconomic burden at high definition. We pioneer innovative robotics to scale brain organoid modelling and combine it with single cell multiOMICs and AI analytics to dissect the principles of the individual host response and render experimentally actionable the authentic genetic backgrounds of differential SARS-CoV-2 sensitivity. Through a substantive engagement of patients\u2019 collectives and health care stakeholders, upstream integration of innovative pipelines streamlines translation and operationalizes precision medicine for emerging medical needs.",

The models\u2019 ability to reproduce variations in the occurrence of extreme events tends to be however much lower. This is particularly true in regions such as the Mediterranean, where extreme events are often driven by small scale processes that are not well reproduced at the resolution at which SPS typically run.\nThe use of artificial intelligence techniques such as machine learning in the study of climate has gained great traction in recent years. The power of those techniques lies in the ability to detect patterns in large datasets without having to make explicit statistical assumptions, allowing to build predictive model whose skill continuously improves as the volume of data on which the models are trained increases. One promising field of application is to use artificial intelligence to improve the prediction of extremes in climate models. In this setting a machine learning model is trained to find relationships between large-scale climate variables (for which dynamical models have a good predictive skill) and the occurrence of extremes.\nThe aim of this project is to improve the predictability of intense Mediterranean cyclones combining advanced artificial intelligence techniques and a state-of-the-art dynamical seasonal prediction system. The project will not only contribute to the knowledge of climate extremes predictability, but also lead to the implementation of a pre-operational dynamical-statistical prediction system with the potential to be extended to include different extremes.",

However, current and near-term intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices are limited in the number of operations that they can carry out before their performance is degraded by interactions with the environment.

Understanding of this process preceding organ dysfunction or damage and identification of biomarkers in the pre-symptomatic stage and risk but also resilience factors of health-to-disease transition will enable targeted and personalized interventions to prevent irreversible organ damage. Metabolites of gut microbiota are key messengers between diet, microbiota and host, maintaining the balance of pro- and anti-inflammation.

The identification of clinical and omics-derived biomarkers will \u2013 by employing AI algorithms - yield a personalized risk / resilience score of chronic inflammation and thus a better prediction of an individual\u2019s risk of transition towards disease. A proof-of-concept intervention study with the anti-inflammatory microbe Akkermansia muciniphila will be conducted to test whether deflections of the microbiome-metabolite-immune axis can be reverted on the biomarker level but also with respect to clinical outcomes and overall well-being. Mobile apps developed by the IMMEDIATE consortium in collaboration with patient organizations tracking numerous lifestyle-related measures and providing guidance and feedback on these aspects will empower individuals to adopt and integrate these knowledge-based health interventions into their own lives, hereby self-managing their own health.",

Its full clinical potential remains largely unrealized though, mostly due to the lack of critical mass capable of integrating the multiple scientific and translational dimensions of microbiota medicine. Grounded on a team of 180leading researchers and entrepreneurs from across 12 countries and dispersed disciplines (biological big data analytics, systems and synthetic biology, experimental and translational medicine), MiCCrobioTAckle will train 12 Doctoral Candidates (DCs) with the much-needed cross-disciplinary and -sectoral expertise to advance microbiota medicine. As course-setting disease, the DCs will focus on cancer cachexia (CC). CC is an excellent model to study the host-microbiota axis in the context of metabolic diseases and represents the paradigm of a devastating condition in urgent need of new and more efficient means of clinical management. Along MiCCrobioTAckle, the 12 high-calibre DCs will foster new discoveries with impact on CC, while driving scientific and technological progress in microbiota medicine in its broadest scope. By training the next generation of researchers with out-of-the-box thinking and an entrepreneurial mindset in microbiota medicine, MiCCrobioTAckle will safeguard the EU leadership in this vanguard and imperative biotech/pharma segment, while paving the way for the development of novel gut microbiota insights and tools to tackle multiple  diseases with foreseeable impact on the well-being of billions of citizens worldwide.",

Despite our increased understanding of the computations performed in these regions, the precise causes and origins of functional specialization in the brain are still a mystery and not accessible to direct experimental approaches.\n\nHere, we propose to combine cutting-edge computational modelling, large-scale sampling of naturalistic behaviour and human neuroimaging to overcome these limitations. Focusing on visual perception, we will exploit the latest advances in artificial neural networks to probe three critical aspects of functional specialization in the ventral visual pathway: First, by training networks on natural and artificial visual categories and identifying which features result in functional specialization, we will characterize what it is about a visual category that leads to functional specialization. Second, we will leverage large-scale egocentric datasets of infant and adult visual input to test how visual experience and natural input statistics shape functional specialization during development. Third, we will ask why certain neural features become specialized for high-level visual categories in the human visual cortex in the first place. Critically, for each of these aspects, we will close the loop and directly test and validate its predictions in the human brain.\n\nOur project will shed light on functional specialization from a new angle \u2013 by relating functional specialization to the computational constraints of performing tasks in the real world. Using this novel approach, our project tackles some of the most fundamental questions about the functional organization of the human mind and brain \u2013 the what, how and why of functional specialization.",

For decades neuroscientists have investigated how the brain orchestrates diverse regions\u2019 activity, pointing at oscillations as one of the key mechanisms involved in such a process. However, previous research has mainly focused on the temporal aspect of oscillatory dynamics, largely overlooking how oscillations propagate through the brain. Although rhythmic traveling waves have recently gained renewed interest, their functional role and relation to cognitive functions remain largely unknown. In this project, I will address this fundamental question: what is the role of oscillatory traveling waves in brain dynamics? I plan to take on this challenge using a multi-scale computational approach, modeling neural dynamics within and between cortical regions, as well as cortical-thalamic interactions. Importantly, the novelty of this approach consists in framing the model in the light of Predictive Coding principles, to test the compelling yet striking hypothesis that traveling waves encode Predictions and Prediction-Errors. The results of the simulations will be compared against experimental recordings in human participants to validate and assess the model\u2019s predictions. Lastly, some implementations will turn into deep learning architectures, to test their dynamics in visual tasks while improving current models of artificial vision. All in all, this proposal can significantly advance our understanding of the neurophysiological mechanisms involved in sensory and cognitive functions, testing whether and how oscillatory traveling waves are a critical mechanism in neural dynamics, and producing fundamental results in the scientific field and future technological applications.",

So far, however, robotic manipulation technology has struggled in managing the uncertainty and unstructuredness that characterize human environments.\nMachine learning is a natural approach -- the robot can adapt to a given scenario, even if it was not programmed to handle it beforehand. Indeed, Deep Reinforcement Learning (deep RL), which has recently led to AI breakthroughs in computer games, has been publicized as the learning-based approach to robotics. To date, however, deep RL studies focused on known and observable systems, where uncertainty was resolved by lengthy trial and error. Quickly learning to act in novel environments, as required for robotics, is not yet within our reach.\nThe crux of the matter is the tight coupling between perception and control under high uncertainty -- the robot must actively reduce uncertainty while also trying to solve the task; for complex and high-dimensional systems, we do not have a suitable algorithmic framework for this.\n\nIn this proposal, our overarching goal is to: \nDevelop the algorithmic framework of using deep learning in problems that tightly couple perception, planning, and control, for advancing robotic AI to reliably manipulate general objects in unstructured environments.\n\nTowards this end, we shall develop neural network representations of uncertainty, and algorithms that estimate uncertainty from data. We will develop theory and algorithms for decision making under uncertainty, bringing in a fresh perspective to the problem based on Bayesian reinforcement learning (Bayes-RL). These advances will allow us to study safety certificates for deep RL, and develop a general and practical methodology for learning-based robotic manipulation under uncertainty, validated on real robot experiments.

Much of the safe robot decision-making literature today focuses on explicit safety constraints defined in the robot state and input space. However, in practical applications, robots are often required to infer semantics-grounded safe actions from perception input.

It relies on electronic components that could replicate the functioning of neurons and synapses. Designing such novel electronics needs the development of cost-effective, fast and reliable materials with tunable functionality. A fundamental understanding of these materials will pave the foundation of innovative device designs and strategies for their large-scale integration for neuromorphic architectures. In this context, the proposed project intends to deliver artificial neurons by developing thin-films of a novel material (TbMnO3) that is capable of demonstrating a Negative Differential Resistance (NDR). The idea is to utilise the fundamental understanding of multi-dimensional (electrical, optical, mechanical and magnetic) control of NDR which is not explored yet and is possible in TbMnO3. NDR enables a two-terminal device to display self-oscillations due to applied electrical spikes. The spiking electrical currents could be used to govern the behaviour of these oscillations and emulating the leaky, integrate, and fire behaviour of biological neurons. Once such a performance is achieved, the device will further be integrated into oscillatory neural networks array for demonstration of complex computing tasks such as image recognition and imitating human behaviour.    \n\nThe project will unite the applicant\u2019s expertise in synaptic devices and materials engineering with the extensive experience of the host-labs in thin-film and neuromorphic devices.

Nature has evolved extremely active catalysts (enzymes) for the conversion of small molecules relevant to energy (H2, CO2, N2). The scalability of these enzymes offers distinct advantages over the rare, precious metals that are currently used in energy conversion. Unfortunately, the enzymes are unable to tolerate the extreme conditions of operating fuel cells or electrolyzers. Directed evolution is a powerful approach for improving enzymes, but is mostly restricted to natural amino acids and biological conditions, with limited compatibility for evolving enzymes toward enhanced resistance in abiotic systems. Here, I aim to establish directed evolution in fully abiotic systems, using artificial amino acids to make artificial enzymes that are stable even in extreme conditions. Towards this, I will establish new electrochemical peptide synthesis platforms to enable the generation of enzyme-length peptides using both natural and artificial amino acids. Extended libraries of artificial enzyme variants will be produced and screened directly on electrode microarrays. Top enzyme candidates for the conversion of H2 will be selected using fuel cell/electrolyzer conditions as the evolutionary criteria. By the end, I will have a new procedure for synthesizing libraries of full-length artificial proteins, enabling the creation of thousands of enzyme variants using artificial building blocks. The generation of high-quality datasets will be transformative to drive future machine learning-based evolution steps for both full size enzymes and small-molecule catalysts with applications beyond H2 evolution.

However, EV adoption is still low for several reasons, mainly concerns about the lack of charging infrastructure from the EV drivers' view, known as range anxiety. Many studies believe deploying more public EV charging stations (EVCSs) can ease this anxiety among EV drivers. Still, EVCSs are not yet widely available due to profitability issues and putting more stress on the grid. While the growth of the EVCSs is moving slowly, the number of household charger installations is growing rapidly. However, scarce studies have investigated the potential of household chargers in providing public charging services. Further, many households are already equipped with renewables and sell the surplus energy to the grid through local flexibility markets. With renewables, household chargers can provide cheaper charging services while minimizing the negative grid impacts of EV charging. This project intends to alleviate the range anxiety in two ways. First, we will enhance the charging infrastructure availability by encouraging households to sell surplus energy to EVs through a market framework called the charging market, besides flexibility markets. We will design a coordinated bidding strategy model from the household viewpoint based on AI to maximize profit from the two markets (Work Package 1). Second, we will improve charging infrastructure accessibility by developing an AI-based charging recommendation model to guide EV drivers on when and where to get recharged (Work Package 2). Finally, we will conduct software implementation and real-time performance validation of the proposed AI-based models (Work Package 3). The complementarity between me, the host supervisor's profile, the environment provided by the host, and the secondment ensure the achievement of this timely and innovative project and the dissemination and exploitation of the results.",

Their technologies readiness level has significantly increased, and the EV can now replace the thermal vehicle in terms of service provided, supporting the EU decarbonisation effort. Besides the reduction of critical material, and decrease of cost, optimising the lifetime of the EV  components is essential to ease their adoption, especially the powertrain sub-components that have the major impact on EV cost and CO2 emissions. A new-generation of diagnostic and prognostic systems for the powertrain will be a game changer to ensure EV adoption, because they will estimate its degradation, anticipate failures, and ease reparability thus extending its lifespan. With significant improvement of sensors, complex modelling and data processing methods such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), predictive maintenance (PdM) has gained a lot of interest in different fields. Development of PdM methods for the sub-components of the EV powertrain (battery, fuel cell, e-motor, power electronics) is at the heart of TEAMING. Thanks to international staff exchanges, TEAMING will significantly improve the different facets of the PdM solution: sensors, modelling, Digital Twins, adapted AI, and Physics-Informed Machine Learning methods are at the centre of the studies and present a major potential in term of innovation. TEAMING will advance PdM system to better diagnose the internal physical phenomena of the different EV powertrain components and optimise their performance, lifetime, safety, and reliability.\"",

It is hence essential to select the element(s) that is most relevant for our objectives and ignore irrelevant ones. One helpful feature for this is that the world is characterized by numerous regularities making it partially predictable. Our brain can extract these regularities from past experience and use them to efficiently guide target selection. Recently, significant scientific interest has been directed to two forms of learning that focus on two types of regularities: in reward-mediated learning (RL), people learn which stimuli are associated with reward, prioritizing the elements related with high (vs. low) reinforcement. Statistical learning (SL), in contrast, allows people to extract statistical regularities from the environment, such as how often a stimulus occurs in a specific location, optimizing future actions toward the location where the relevant element appears frequently. In everyday life RL and SL coexist and they jointly guide our selection of relevant stimuli. However, they have been mainly addressed separately using divergent tasks, hindering a direct comparison of the results and assessing their combined influence. This project seeks to bridge this gap by systematically comparing RL and SL in a systematic and well-balanced experimental setup to understand how people implicitly learn from their past experience. Using a series of consistent experimental tasks, behavioral, ocular and electroencephalography measures will be recorded from healthy human volunteers to assess the individual and joint effect of RL and SL on the process dynamics from target selection until response execution. Furthermore, employing Markov decision process models, we will compare the observed performance with model performance. Jointly, our results will provide important insights into real-world learning mechanisms.",

            "objective": "In recent years, the use of machine learning (ML) for the study of physics has experienced a strong boost. However, most of the machines used are black boxes, and the causal relation between inputs and outputs is often impossible to extract. Nonetheless, a critical aspect when dealing with physical systems is not only to make correct predictions, but to understand the physical laws which underlie these assessments. Recently, an increasing number of works aim at developing interpretable ML methods, from which such hidden laws can be extracted. However, their application to physics has been often limited to supervised and unsupervised learning approaches.\nThe aim of this project is: 1) construct an interpretable reinforcement learning method; 2) extract hidden rules and features in timely and paramount problems in physics. The method combines three well-established concepts of ML: projective simulation, graph neural networks (GNN) and hidden variable disentanglement. PS provides interpretable RL agents that can be trained for a variety of tasks, from the construction of quantum experiments, via skill acquisition in robotics, to the modelling of honeybee colonies. By enhancing their learning power and interpretability with GNNs and variable disentanglement, we will extract the hidden features of the systems the RL agents have interacted with and ultimately, the physical laws governing them. In particular, we will tackle problems in the field of condensed matter, where particles diffuse either passively or actively, to reach a target state. Moreover, we will consider ensembles of RL agents, so as to analyze not only the physical properties of the systems, but also their interactions and communication dynamics in the quest of a common target.\nThe originality of the proposal is directly related to: 1) the methods that will be developed; 2) the systems of study; 3) most importantly, the information we will access and discover with the interpretable RL agents.",

Indeed, driven by the increasing complexity of the entire aviation ecosystem (aircraft, air traffic control \u2013 ATC, airports), digitalisation provides solutions in the form of Digital Assistants (DAs) that, by teaming with their human counterparts (pilots, ATC operators, airport operators), support the execution of tasks to ensure safe and profitable operations in complex scenarios. JARVIS Consortium \u2013 led by Collins Aerospace \u2013 aims at developing and validating three ATM solutions: an Airborne DA (AIR-DA, TRL4), an ATC-DA (TRL4), and an Airport DA (AP-DA, TRL6). The AIR-DA will increase the level of automation in the flight deck and thanks to AI-based actions will act as enabler towards reduced crew operations and single pilot operations. The adoption of the AIR-DA will allow pilots to deal with complex scenarios without compromising safety, security, while reducing the pilot workload. The ATC-DA will increase the level of automation in control towers, where environmental KPIs and the capacity management of airspace will benefit from the adoption of AI-based technologies. Finally, the AP-DA will increase the level of automation in airports, enhancing safety and security for intrusion detection scenarios. The adoption of AI-driven technologies in the aviation ecosystem represents an appealing concept but entails challenges. JARVIS will address key challenges common to the three different DAs: i) assured AI design, to deliver trustworthy, explainable, safe, and ethical decision-making algorithms; ii) Human AI Teaming, to deliver human-centric designs to maximise the teamwork between humans and autonomous systems; iii) big data and cloud infrastructures for the proper management of data moving from a centralised architecture to a more edge-to-cloud architectures.",

In the past years, enormous efforts have been made to unravel their mathematical properties, leading to fundamental insights and mathematical guarantees on when and why deep learning works well. ANNs are inspired by biological neural networks (BNNs) but differ in many respects: ANNs represent functions while BNNs represent stochastic processes, and the gradient-based deep learning applied for ANNs is very different from the local updating of BNNs. \nBNNs are superior to ANNs in the sense that the brain learns faster and generalizes better. Despite the urgency for answers and the rich and interesting mathematical structures that BNNs create, scarcely any theoretical attempts have been made to understand learning in the brain. The stochastic process structure of BNNs and the need to understand the statistical convergence behavior call for a mathematical statistics approach. This project proposes the development of advanced mathematical tools in nonparametric and high- dimensional statistics to analyze learning in BNNs as a statistical method. The starting point is a novel interpretation of the local updating of BNN parameters as a specific and non-standard, derivative-free optimization method. Whereas derivative-free optimization is thought to be slow, our conjecture is that it leads to favorable statistical properties in the setting underlying BNNs. \nIf the research is successful, it has the potential to open a new research area in mathematical statistics and provide insights into how the brain learns. It could also lead to recommendations on how to make AI more efficient with less training data and how to train neuromorphic computer chips mimicking BNNs.",

Despite this tremendous success, artificial intelligence systems still face major challenges due to their reliance on extensive training and large datasets. Recent reports indicate that the architecture of ANNs could be a prime target for reducing their training and data requirements.\n\nWe hypothesize that such architectural features can be identified from neuronal networks in the brain, which have evolved to efficiently perform highly specialized functions. Recent advances in electron microscopy will soon provide detailed reconstructions of large-scale neuronal networks from different brain areas, species, developmental stages and/or pathological conditions. However, even if such data become available, directly transforming neuronal network reconstructions into ANNs will raise problems of interpretability, due to their enormous complexity, and generalizability, due to high inter-individual variability.\n\nHere, we will resolve these challenges by implementing a set of computational approaches that allow the extraction of rules that explain the wiring properties underlying dense connectomics data, the transfer of these anatomical principles into the design of ANN architectures, and the evaluation of how these principles impact performance on a battery of deep learning tasks. This unique methodology will lay the foundation for groundbreaking insights into how different network architectures facilitate specific brain functions, and also how the underlying anatomical principles can inform the development of more effective and efficient artificial intelligence systems.\n\nOur methodology will be publicly accessible online to scientists, but also to companies and non-profit organizations that seek to improve the performance or reduce training data requirements for applications of deep learning.",

As our society is facing a dramatic increase in inequalities and intersectional discrimination, we need to prevent AI systems to amplify this phenomenon but rather mitigate it. To trust these systems, domain experts and stakeholders need to trust the decisions.\nFairness stands as one of the main principles of Trustworthy AI promoted at EU level. How these principles, in particular fairness, translate into technical, functional social, and lawful requirements in the AI system design is still an open question. Similarly we don\u2019t know how to test if a system is compliant with these principles and repair it in case it is not.\nAEQUITAS proposes the design of a controlled experimentation environment for developers and users to create controlled experiments for\n- assessing the bias in AI systems, e.g., identifying potential causes of bias in data, algorithms, and interpretation of results,\n- providing, when possible, effective methods and engineering guidelines to repair, remove, and mitigate bias,\n- provide fairness-by-design guidelines, methodologies, and software engineering techniques to design new bias-free systems\nThe experimentation environment generates synthetic data sets with different features influencing fairness for a test in laboratories. Real use cases in health care, human resources and social disadvantaged group challenges further test the experimentation platform showcasing the effectiveness of the solution proposed. The experimentation playground will be integrated on the AI-on-demand platform to boost its uptake, but a stand-alone release will enable on-premise privacy-preserving test of AI-systems fairness.\nAEQUITAS relies on a strong consortium featuring AI experts, domain experts in the use case sectors as well as social scientists and associations defending rights of minorities and discriminated groups.",

Furthermore, AIMIX will investigate the socio-ethical principles and requirements that govern inclusive AI, and examine how they compare, conflict or complement those of trustworthy AI developed thus far in high-income settings. These innovations will be demonstrated for affordable and accessible AI-powered obstetric ultrasound screening by minimally trained clinicians such as midwives in rural Africa.\n\nUltimately, AIMIX\u2019s scientific breakthroughs will enhance the democratisation of imaging AI in resource-limited settings, which will result in an important social impact, by empowering local communities, promoting inclusion, and reducing disparities between populations from low- and high-income societies.",

However, structures are only a piece of the puzzle. To understand the mechanisms underlying biological functions, we need to characterize the conformational landscape of proteins, the population of relevant states, and their pathways of interconversion. Furthermore, we need to determine the effect of the environment in modulating structures, populations, and pathways, as biological systems perform their functions in the complexity of cells rather than in the isolation of test tubes. None of these objectives can be achieved by AI structure-prediction methods alone. In this proposal we will leverage the PI\u2019s expertise in the field of integrative computational-experimental techniques to develop, apply, and disseminate bAIes, a modelling approach that will enable attaining these goals. bAIes will make synergistic use of AI structural models, experimental data, and molecular simulations driven by accurate physico-chemical models to characterize protein structure and dynamics. We will demonstrate how bAIes can solve biological problems that exceed the capabilities of AI approaches,  such as the characterization of protein disordered regions and the determination of structure and dynamics in situ, with a particular focus on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The outcome of this proposal will be a versatile, accurate and efficient method that will push the boundaries of what can be achieved with AI structure-prediction methods. bAIes will be implemented in the widely used PLUMED library, of which the PI is founder and core developer, thus enabling its application to a wide variety of systems and biological problems beyond those envisioned here.",

            "objective": "This year has seen a breakthrough in structural bioinformatics - deep learning-based methods, most notably Google DeepMind's AlphaFold2, have demonstrated near-experimental accuracy of protein structure predictions. However, even the best protein structure prediction methods do not automatically provide knowledge about protein dynamics and protein interactions, which is often essential to understand or predict the biological functions of proteins. Those functions are performed via intermolecular interactions, and such interactions almost always involve conformational changes of engaged partners. The problem of modeling dynamic protein structures and their complexes is still largely unsolved - this project aims to significantly contribute towards its future solution by exploring the link between computational geometry, statistical physics, and machine learning. The postdoctoral researcher will develop novel methods that: given a dynamic (moving) molecular structure, efficiently compute tessellation-derived contact areas; given a starting structure and its tessellation-derived contacts areas, predict (using a graph neural network) how the interatomic contact areas will change upon motion; given a protein complex model generated by docking, use the predicted statistical properties of the contact areas to estimate (using a graph neural network) the protein-protein binding energy score. If successfully developed, such methods will provide unique data about the dynamics of tessellation-derived interatomic contact areas. Most importantly, they will provide effective dynamics-aware scores for assessing and ranking structural models of protein complexes.",

Both projects aim to advance current models beyond static structural predictions to include dynamics and interactions.

Additionally, both projects acknowledge the potential shortcomings of existing methods like AlphaFold2 and aim to enhance its capabilities. Merging these projects could significantly improve resource efficiency by harmonizing their shared goals and methodologies. However, MARMOTTE employs a unique approach, focusing specifically on tessellation-derived contact areas and using graph neural networks to predict protein motions and interactions, while bAIes focuses more broadly on integrating AI-driven models with experimental data and molecular simulations to understand protein dynamics.

State-of-the art clinical risk prediction models for CVD use conventional risk factors and polygenic scores (PGS)\u2014a measure of an individuals\u2019 inherited CVD risk. However, the accuracy of current models is moderate and worse in women than men. Protein markers of CVD represent an individual\u2019s current health state and both inherited and environmental disease risk. Indeed, there is evidence that combining conventional risk factors, PGS, and protein markers of CVD may facilitate vast improvements in CVD risk prediction. Furthermore, by modelling inflammation-specific protein markers missing from sex-specific CVD risk models, ProtectHearts will specifically capture excess risk in women.\n\nProtectHearts will use the world\u2019s largest population-biobank-linked proteomics datasets to 1) develop a novel protein-based risk score (ProtRS); 2) develop an inflammation-specific ProtRS (i-ProtRS); and 3) estimate the clinical utility of these scores when modelled with clinical risk scores and PGS. Cutting-edge machine learning algorithms will be used to establish target proteins for CVD prediction in 100,000 individuals across four European biobanks. \n\nProtectHearts brings together a physician-scientist Supervisor with proteomics expertise and a Fellow with experience modelling CVD risk prediction using PGS in biobanks. Through a secondment and non-academic placement, the Fellow will gain intersectoral experience. Activities of the training and dissemination work packages will build her competencies in machine learning, advanced statistics and science communication. ProtectHearts will engage clinicians in exploitation of the new sex-specific, comprehensive CVD risk prediction model. \n\nProtectHearts has the potential to move CVD risk prediction beyond state-of-the-art by improving risk prediction accuracy, specifically in women, using protein-based markers for CVD and CVD-related inflammation.",

The exploration of existing clinical, genetic and real-world data sources can contribute to this direction, however several challenges related to the data availability, management and processing remain open. \nThe 48-month project CVDLINK aims to tackle these challenges by implementing a privacy-by-design European-wide federated platform-as-a-service (PaaS) for the delivery of effective data-driven human-centric interventions and the advancement of research and management in the CVD domain. CVDLINK is based on two major offerings: (1) the seamless and legally compliant linking and integration, secure sharing and automated curation of existing data; and (2) a set of AI and data-enabled precision medicine tools and pipelines, for better diagnosis, risk stratification and treatment.  \nIn the context of the project, 7 different cardiovascular conditions will be examined, making use of different retrospective datasets, cohort studies and biobanks from 7 counties, aiming to set a paradigm of the how heterogeneous data sources, can be effectively exploited for building comprehensive AI-driven tools, in order to bring substantial benefits for health systems, patients, industry and EU citizens.
