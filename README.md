# Horizon Europe AI Projects Analysis
This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook that was used to conduct the analysis of AI projects funded under the Horizon Europe program. The analysis explores the fragmentation of research, project overlap, and potential budget savings.

Please note that this code is a rough draft, as I was experimenting with various approaches and didn't focus much on code organization or cleanliness. Feel free to explore and adapt as needed.

You can read the corresponding blog post that explains the analysis in detail at [link X].
